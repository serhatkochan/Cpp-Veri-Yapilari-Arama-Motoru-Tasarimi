THE GAMBLER
FYODOR DOSTOEVSKY
Translated by CJ Hogarth
I
At length I returned from two weeks leave of absence to find that my patrons
had arrived three days ago in Roulettenberg. I received from them a welcome
quite different to that which I had expected. The General eyed me coldly,
greeted me in rather haughty fashion, and dismissed me to pay my respects to
his sister. It was clear that from SOMEWHERE money had been acquired. I
thought I could even detect a certain shamefacedness in the General’s glance.
Maria Philipovna, too, seemed distraught, and conversed with me with an air of
detachment. Nevertheless, she took the money which I handed to her, counted
it, and listened to what I had to tell. To luncheon there were expected that day
a Monsieur Mezentsov, a French lady, and an Englishman; for, whenever
money was in hand, a banquet in Muscovite style was always given. Polina
Alexandrovna, on seeing me, inquired why I had been so long away. Then,
without waiting for an answer, she departed. Evidently this was not mere
accident, and I felt that I must throw some light upon matters. It was high time
that I did so.
I was assigned a small room on the fourth floor of the hotel (for you must know
that I belonged to the General’s suite). So far as I could see, the party had
already gained some notoriety in the place, which had come to look upon the
General as a Russian nobleman of great wealth. Indeed, even before luncheon
he charged me, among other things, to get two thousand-franc notes changed
for him at the hotel counter, which put us in a position to be thought
2
millionaires at all events for a week! Later, I was about to take Mischa and
Nadia for a walk when a summons reached me from the staircase that I must
attend the General. He began by deigning to inquire of me where I was going
to take the children; and as he did so, I could see that he failed to look me in
the eyes. He WANTED to do so, but each time was met by me with such a
fixed, disrespectful stare that he desisted in confusion. In pompous language,
however, which jumbled one sentence into another, and at length grew
disconnected, he gave me to understand that I was to lead the children
altogether away from the Casino, and out into the park. Finally his anger
exploded, and he added sharply:
“I suppose you would like to take them to the Casino to play roulette? Well,
excuse my speaking so plainly, but I know how addicted you are to gambling.
Though I am not your mentor, nor wish to be, at least I have a right to require
that you shall not actually compromise me.”
“I have no money for gambling,” I quietly replied.
“But you will soon be in receipt of some,” retorted the General, reddening a
little as he dived into his writing desk and applied himself to a memorandum
book. From it he saw that he had 120 roubles of mine in his keeping.
“Let us calculate,” he went on. “We must translate these roubles into thalers.
Here--take 100 thalers, as a round sum. The rest will be safe in my hands.”
In silence I took the money.
“You must not be offended at what I say,” he continued. “You are too touchy
about these things. What I have said I have said merely as a warning. To do so
is no more than my right.”
When returning home with the children before luncheon, I met a cavalcade of
our party riding to view some ruins. Two splendid carriages, magnificently
horsed, with Mlle. Blanche, Maria Philipovna, and Polina Alexandrovna in one of
them, and the Frenchman, the Englishman, and the General in attendance on
horseback! The passers-by stopped to stare at them, for the effect was
splendid--the General could not have improved upon it. I calculated that, with
3
the 4000 francs which I had brought with me, added to what my patrons
seemed already to have acquired, the party must be in possession of at least
7000 or 8000 francs--though that would be none too much for Mlle. Blanche,
who, with her mother and the Frenchman, was also lodging in our hotel. The
latter gentleman was called by the lacqueys “Monsieur le Comte,” and Mlle.
Blanche’s mother was dubbed “Madame la Comtesse.” Perhaps in very truth
they WERE “Comte et Comtesse.”
I knew that “Monsieur le Comte” would take no notice of me when we met at
dinner, as also that the General would not dream of introducing us, nor of
recommending me to the “Comte.” However, the latter had lived awhile in
Russia, and knew that the person referred to as an “uchitel” is never looked
upon as a bird of fine feather. Of course, strictly speaking, he knew me; but I
was an uninvited guest at the luncheon--the General had forgotten to arrange
otherwise, or I should have been dispatched to dine at the table d’hote.
Nevertheless, I presented myself in such guise that the General looked at me
with a touch of approval; and, though the good Maria Philipovna was for
showing me my place, the fact of my having previously met the Englishman,
Mr. Astley, saved me, and thenceforward I figured as one of the company.
This strange Englishman I had met first in Prussia, where we had happened to
sit vis-a-vis in a railway train in which I was travelling to overtake our party;
while, later, I had run across him in France, and again in Switzerland--twice
within the space of two weeks! To think, therefore, that I should suddenly
encounter him again here, in Roulettenberg! Never in my life had I known a
more retiring man, for he was shy to the pitch of imbecility, yet well aware of
the fact (for he was no fool). At the same time, he was a gentle, amiable sort
of an individual, and, even on our first encounter in Prussia I had contrived to
draw him out, and he had told me that he had just been to the North Cape, and
was now anxious to visit the fair at Nizhni Novgorod. How he had come to
make the General’s acquaintance I do not know, but, apparently, he was much
struck with Polina. Also, he was delighted that I should sit next him at table, for
he appeared to look upon me as his bosom friend.
During the meal the Frenchman was in great feather: he was discursive and 
4
pompous to every one. In Moscow too, I remembered, he had blown a great
many bubbles. Interminably he discoursed on finance and Russian politics, and
though, at times, the General made feints to contradict him, he did so humbly,
and as though wishing not wholly to lose sight of his own dignity.
For myself, I was in a curious frame of mind. Even before luncheon was half
finished I had asked myself the old, eternal question: “WHY do I continue to
dance attendance upon the General, instead of having left him and his family
long ago?” Every now and then I would glance at Polina Alexandrovna, but she
paid me no attention; until eventually I became so irritated that I decided to
play the boor.
First of all I suddenly, and for no reason whatever, plunged loudly and
gratuitously into the general conversation. Above everything I wanted to pick a
quarrel with the Frenchman; and, with that end in view I turned to the General,
and exclaimed in an overbearing sort of way--indeed, I think that I actually
interrupted him--that that summer it had been almost impossible for a Russian
to dine anywhere at tables d’hote. The General bent upon me a glance of
astonishment.
“If one is a man of self-respect,” I went on, “one risks abuse by so doing, and
is forced to put up with insults of every kind. Both at Paris and on the Rhine,
and even in Switzerland--there are so many Poles, with their sympathisers, the
French, at these tables d’hote that one cannot get a word in edgeways if one
happens only to be a Russian.”
This I said in French. The General eyed me doubtfully, for he did not know
whether to be angry or merely to feel surprised that I should so far forget
myself.
“Of course, one always learns SOMETHING EVERYWHERE,” said the Frenchman
in a careless, contemptuous sort of tone.
“In Paris, too, I had a dispute with a Pole,” I continued, “and then with a
French officer who supported him. After that a section of the Frenchmen
present took my part. They did so as soon as I told them the story of how once
I threatened to spit into Monsignor’s coffee.”
5
“To spit into it?” the General inquired with grave disapproval in his tone, and a
stare, of astonishment, while the Frenchman looked at me unbelievingly.
“Just so,” I replied. “You must know that, on one occasion, when, for two days,
I had felt certain that at any moment I might have to depart for Rome on
business, I repaired to the Embassy of the Holy See in Paris, to have my
passport visaed. There I encountered a sacristan of about fifty, and a man dry
and cold of mien. After listening politely, but with great reserve, to my account
of myself, this sacristan asked me to wait a little. I was in a great hurry to
depart, but of course I sat down, pulled out a copy of L’Opinion Nationale, and
fell to reading an extraordinary piece of invective against Russia which it
happened to contain. As I was thus engaged I heard some one enter an
adjoining room and ask for Monsignor; after which I saw the sacristan make a
low bow to the visitor, and then another bow as the visitor took his leave. I
ventured to remind the good man of my own business also; whereupon, with
an expression of, if anything, increased dryness, he again asked me to wait.
Soon a third visitor arrived who, like myself, had come on business (he was an
Austrian of some sort); and as soon as ever he had stated his errand he was
conducted upstairs! This made me very angry. I rose, approached the
sacristan, and told him that, since Monsignor was receiving callers, his lordship
might just as well finish off my affair as well. Upon this the sacristan shrunk
back in astonishment. It simply passed his understanding that any insignificant
Russian should dare to compare himself with other visitors of Monsignor’s! In a
tone of the utmost effrontery, as though he were delighted to have a chance of
insulting me, he looked me up and down, and then said: “Do you suppose that
Monsignor is going to put aside his coffee for YOU?” But I only cried the louder:
“Let me tell you that I am going to SPIT into that coffee! Yes, and if you do not
get me my passport visaed this very minute, I shall take it to Monsignor
myself.”
“What? While he is engaged with a Cardinal? screeched the sacristan, again
shrinking back in horror. Then, rushing to the door, he spread out his arms as
though he would rather die than let me enter.
Thereupon I declared that I was a heretic and a barbarian--“Je suis heretique et
6
barbare,” I said, “and that these archbishops and cardinals and monsignors,
and the rest of them, meant nothing at all to me. In a word, I showed him that
I was not going to give way. He looked at me with an air of infinite resentment.
Then he snatched up my passport, and departed with it upstairs. A minute later
the passport had been visaed! Here it is now, if you care to see it,”--and I
pulled out the document, and exhibited the Roman visa.
“But--“ the General began.
“What really saved you was the fact that you proclaimed yourself a heretic and
a barbarian,” remarked the Frenchman with a smile. “Cela n’etait pas si bete.”
“But is that how Russian subjects ought to be treated? Why, when they settle
here they dare not utter even a word--they are ready even to deny the fact
that they are Russians! At all events, at my hotel in Paris I received far more
attention from the company after I had told them about the fracas with the
sacristan. A fat Polish nobleman, who had been the most offensive of all who
were present at the table d’hote, at once went upstairs, while some of the
Frenchmen were simply disgusted when I told them that two years ago I had
encountered a man at whom, in 1812, a French ‘hero’ fired for the mere fun of
discharging his musket. That man was then a boy of ten and his family are still
residing in Moscow.”
“Impossible!” the Frenchman spluttered. “No French soldier would fire at a
child!”
“Nevertheless the incident was as I say,” I replied. “A very respected
ex-captain told me the story, and I myself could see the scar left on his cheek.”
The Frenchman then began chattering volubly, and the General supported him;
but I recommended the former to read, for example, extracts from the
memoirs of General Perovski, who, in 1812, was a prisoner in the hands of the
French. Finally Maria Philipovna said something to interrupt the conversation.
The General was furious with me for having started the altercation with the
Frenchman. On the other hand, Mr. Astley seemed to take great pleasure in my
brush with Monsieur, and, rising from the table, proposed that we should go
and have a drink together. The same afternoon, at four o’clock, I went to have
7
my customary talk with Polina Alexandrovna; and, the talk soon extended to a
stroll. We entered the Park, and approached the Casino, where Polina seated
herself upon a bench near the fountain, and sent Nadia away to a little distance
to play with some other children. Mischa also I dispatched to play by the
fountain, and in this fashion we--that is to say, Polina and myself--contrived to
find ourselves alone.
Of course, we began by talking on business matters. Polina seemed furious
when I handed her only 700 gulden, for she had thought to receive from Paris,
as the proceeds of the pledging of her diamonds, at least 2000 gulden, or even
more.
“Come what may, I MUST have money,” she said. “And get it somehow I
will--otherwise I shall be ruined.”
I asked her what had happened during my absence.
“Nothing; except that two pieces of news have reached us from St. Petersburg.
In the first place, my grandmother is very ill, and unlikely to last another
couple of days. We had this from Timothy Petrovitch himself, and he is a
reliable person. Every moment we are expecting to receive news of the end.”
“All of you are on the tiptoe of expectation? “ I queried.
“Of course--all of us, and every minute of the day. For a year-and-a-half now
we have been looking for this.”
“Looking for it?”
“Yes, looking for it. I am not her blood relation, you know--I am merely the
General’s step-daughter. Yet I am certain that the old lady has remembered me
in her will.”
“Yes, I believe that you WILL come in for a good deal,” I said with some
assurance.
“Yes, for she is fond of me. But how come you to think so?”
I answered this question with another one. “That Marquis of yours,” I said, “--is
8
HE also familiar with your family secrets?”
“And why are you yourself so interested in them?” was her retort as she eyed
me with dry grimness.
“Never mind. If I am not mistaken, the General has succeeded in borrowing
money of the Marquis.”
“It may be so.”
“Is it likely that the Marquis would have lent the money if he had not known
something or other about your grandmother? Did you notice, too, that three
times during luncheon, when speaking of her, he called her ‘La Baboulenka’?
[Dear little Grandmother]. What loving, friendly behaviour, to be sure!”
“Yes, that is true. As soon as ever he learnt that I was likely to inherit
something from her he began to pay me his addresses. I thought you ought to
know that.”
“Then he has only just begun his courting? Why, I thought he had been doing
so a long while!”
“You KNOW he has not,” retorted Polina angrily. “But where on earth did you
pick up this Englishman?” She said this after a pause.
“I KNEW you would ask about him!” Whereupon I told her of my previous
encounters with Astley while travelling.
“He is very shy,” I said, “and susceptible. Also, he is in love with you.--“
”Yes, he is in love with me,” she replied.
“And he is ten times richer than the Frenchman. In fact, what does the
Frenchman possess? To me it seems at least doubtful that he possesses
anything at all.”
“Oh, no, there is no doubt about it. He does possess some chateau or other.
Last night the General told me that for certain. NOW are you satisfied? “
”Nevertheless, in your place I should marry the Englishman.”
9
“And why?” asked Polina.
“Because, though the Frenchman is the handsomer of the two, he is also the
baser; whereas the Englishman is not only a man of honour, but ten times the
wealthier of the pair.”
“Yes? But then the Frenchman is a marquis, and the cleverer of the two,”
remarked Polina imperturbably.
“Is that so?” I repeated.
“Yes; absolutely.”
Polina was not at all pleased at my questions; I could see that she was doing
her best to irritate me with the brusquerie of her answers. But I took no notice
of this.
“It amuses me to see you grow angry,” she continued. “However, inasmuch as
I allow you to indulge in these questions and conjectures, you ought to pay me
something for the privilege.”
“I consider that I have a perfect right to put these questions to you,” was my
calm retort; “for the reason that I am ready to pay for them, and also care little
what becomes of me.”
Polina giggled.
“Last time you told me--when on the Shlangenberg--that at a word from me
you would be ready to jump down a thousand feet into the abyss. Some day I
may remind you of that saying, in order to see if you will be as good as your
word. Yes, you may depend upon it that I shall do so. I hate you because I
have allowed you to go to such lengths, and I also hate you and still
more--because you are so necessary to me. For the time being I want you, so I
must keep you.”
Then she made a movement to rise. Her tone had sounded very angry. Indeed,
of late her talks with me had invariably ended on a note of temper and
irritation--yes, of real temper.
10
“May I ask you who is this Mlle. Blanche?” I inquired (since I did not wish Polina
to depart without an explanation).
“You KNOW who she is--just Mlle. Blanche. Nothing further has transpired.
Probably she will soon be Madame General--that is to say, if the rumours that
Grandmamma is nearing her end should prove true. Mlle. Blanche, with her
mother and her cousin, the Marquis, know very well that, as things now stand,
we are ruined.”
“And is the General at last in love?”
“That has nothing to do with it. Listen to me. Take these 700 florins, and go
and play roulette with them. Win as much for me as you can, for I am badly in
need of money.
So saying, she called Nadia back to her side, and entered the Casino, where
she joined the rest of our party. For myself, I took, in musing astonishment,
the first path to the left. Something had seemed to strike my brain when she
told me to go and play roulette. Strangely enough, that something had also
seemed to make me hesitate, and to set me analysing my feelings with regard
to her. In fact, during the two weeks of my absence I had felt far more at my
ease than I did now, on the day of my return; although, while travelling, I had
moped like an imbecile, rushed about like a man in a fever, and actually beheld
her in my dreams. Indeed, on one occasion (this happened in Switzerland,
when I was asleep in the train) I had spoken aloud to her, and set all my
fellow-travellers laughing. Again, therefore, I put to myself the question: “Do I,
or do I not love her?” and again I could return myself no answer or, rather, for
the hundredth time I told myself that I detested her. Yes, I detested her; there
were moments (more especially at the close of our talks together) when I
would gladly have given half my life to have strangled her! I swear that, had
there, at such moments, been a sharp knife ready to my hand, I would have
seized that knife with pleasure, and plunged it into her breast. Yet I also swear
that if, on the Shlangenberg, she had REALLY said to me, “Leap into that
abyss,” I should have leapt into it, and with equal pleasure. Yes, this I knew
well. One way or the other, the thing must soon be ended. She, too, knew it in
some curious way; the thought that I was fully conscious of her inaccessibility,
11
and of the impossibility of my ever realising my dreams, afforded her, I am
certain, the keenest possible pleasure. Otherwise, is it likely that she, the
cautious and clever woman that she was, would have indulged in this familiarity
and openness with me? Hitherto (I concluded) she had looked upon me in the
same light that the old Empress did upon her servant--the Empress who
hesitated not to unrobe herself before her slave, since she did not account a
slave a man. Yes, often Polina must have taken me for something less than a
man!”
Still, she had charged me with a commission--to win what I could at roulette.
Yet all the time I could not help wondering WHY it was so necessary for her to
win something, and what new schemes could have sprung to birth in her
ever-fertile brain. A host of new and unknown factors seemed to have arisen
during the last two weeks. Well, it behoved me to divine them, and to probe
them, and that as soon as possible. Yet not now: at the present moment I must
repair to the roulette-table.
II
I confess I did not like it. Although I had made up my mind to play, I felt
averse to doing so on behalf of some one else. In fact, it almost upset my
balance, and I entered the gaming rooms with an angry feeling at my heart. At
first glance the scene irritated me. Never at any time have I been able to bear
the flunkeyishness which one meets in the Press of the world at large, but more
especially in that of Russia, where, almost every evening, journalists write on
two subjects in particular namely, on the splendour and luxury of the casinos to
be found in the Rhenish towns, and on the heaps of gold which are daily to be
seen lying on their tables. Those journalists are not paid for doing so: they
write thus merely out of a spirit of disinterested complaisance. For there is
nothing splendid about the establishments in question; and, not only are there
no heaps of gold to be seen lying on their tables, but also there is very little
money to be seen at all. Of course, during the season, some madman or
another may make his appearance--generally an Englishman, or an Asiatic, or a
Turk--and (as had happened during the summer of which I write) win or lose a
great deal; but, as regards the rest of the crowd, it plays only for petty gulden,
12
and seldom does much wealth figure on the board.
When, on the present occasion, I entered the gaming-rooms (for the first time
in my life), it was several moments before I could even make up my mind to
play. For one thing, the crowd oppressed me. Had I been playing for myself, I
think I should have left at once, and never have embarked upon gambling at
all, for I could feel my heart beginning to beat, and my heart was anything but
cold-blooded. Also, I knew, I had long ago made up my mind, that never
should I depart from Roulettenberg until some radical, some final, change had
taken place in my fortunes. Thus, it must and would be. However ridiculous it
may seem to you that I was expecting to win at roulette, I look upon the
generally accepted opinion concerning the folly and the grossness of hoping to
win at gambling as a thing even more absurd. For why is gambling a whit
worse than any other method of acquiring money? How, for instance, is it
worse than trade? True, out of a hundred persons, only one can win; yet what
business is that of yours or of mine?
At all events, I confined myself at first simply to looking on, and decided to
attempt nothing serious. Indeed, I felt that, if I began to do anything at all, I
should do it in an absent-minded, haphazard sort of way--of that I felt certain.
Also. it behoved me to learn the game itself; since, despite a thousand
descriptions of roulette which I had read with ceaseless avidity, I knew nothing
of its rules, and had never even seen it played.
In the first place, everything about it seemed to me so foul--so morally mean
and foul. Yet I am not speaking of the hungry, restless folk who, by scores nay,
even by hundreds--could be seen crowded around the gaming-tables. For in a
desire to win quickly and to win much I can see nothing sordid; I have always
applauded the opinion of a certain dead and gone, but cocksure, moralist who
replied to the excuse that “ one may always gamble moderately “, by saying
that to do so makes things worse, since, in that case, the profits too will always
be moderate.
Insignificant profits and sumptuous profits do not stand on the same footing.
No, it is all a matter of proportion. What may seem a small sum to a Rothschild
may seem a large sum to me, and it is not the fault of stakes or of winnings
13
that everywhere men can be found winning, can be found depriving their
fellows of something, just as they do at roulette. As to the question whether
stakes and winnings are, in themselves, immoral is another question
altogether, and I wish to express no opinion upon it. Yet the very fact that I
was full of a strong desire to win caused this gambling for gain, in spite of its
attendant squalor, to contain, if you will, something intimate, something
sympathetic, to my eyes: for it is always pleasant to see men dispensing with
ceremony, and acting naturally, and in an unbuttoned mood. . . .
Yet, why should I so deceive myself? I could see that the whole thing was a
vain and unreasoning pursuit; and what, at the first glance, seemed to me the
ugliest feature in this mob of roulette players was their respect for their
occupation--the seriousness, and even the humility, with which they stood
around the gaming tables. Moreover, I had always drawn sharp distinctions
between a game which is de mauvais genre and a game which is permissible to
a decent man. In fact, there are two sorts of gaming--namely, the game of the
gentleman and the game of the plebs--the game for gain, and the game of the
herd. Herein, as said, I draw sharp distinctions. Yet how essentially base are
the distinctions! For instance, a gentleman may stake, say, five or ten louis
d’or--seldom more, unless he is a very rich man, when he may stake, say, a
thousand francs; but, he must do this simply for the love of the game
itself--simply for sport, simply in order to observe the process of winning or of
losing, and, above all things, as a man who remains quite uninterested in the
possibility of his issuing a winner. If he wins, he will be at liberty, perhaps, to
give vent to a laugh, or to pass a remark on the circumstance to a bystander,
or to stake again, or to double his stake; but, even this he must do solely out
of curiosity, and for the pleasure of watching the play of chances and of
calculations, and not because of any vulgar desire to win. In a word, he must
look upon the gaming-table, upon roulette, and upon trente et quarante, as
mere relaxations which have been arranged solely for his amusement. Of the
existence of the lures and gains upon which the bank is founded and
maintained he must profess to have not an inkling. Best of all, he ought to
imagine his fellow-gamblers and the rest of the mob which stands trembling
over a coin to be equally rich and gentlemanly with himself, and playing solely
14
for recreation and pleasure. This complete ignorance of the realities, this
innocent view of mankind, is what, in my opinion, constitutes the truly
aristocratic. For instance, I have seen even fond mothers so far indulge their
guileless, elegant daughters--misses of fifteen or sixteen--as to give them a
few gold coins and teach them how to play; and though the young ladies may
have won or have lost, they have invariably laughed, and departed as though
they were well pleased. In the same way, I saw our General once approach the
table in a stolid, important manner. A lacquey darted to offer him a chair, but
the General did not even notice him. Slowly he took out his money bags, and
slowly extracted 300 francs in gold, which he staked on the black, and won. Yet
he did not take up his winnings--he left them there on the table. Again the
black turned up, and again he did not gather in what he had won; and when, in
the third round, the RED turned up he lost, at a stroke, 1200 francs. Yet even
then he rose with a smile, and thus preserved his reputation; yet I knew that
his money bags must be chafing his heart, as well as that, had the stake been
twice or thrice as much again, he would still have restrained himself from
venting his disappointment.
On the other hand, I saw a Frenchman first win, and then lose, 30,000 francs
cheerfully, and without a murmur. Yes; even if a gentleman should lose his
whole substance, he must never give way to annoyance. Money must be so
subservient to gentility as never to be worth a thought. Of course, the
SUPREMELY aristocratic thing is to be entirely oblivious of the mire of rabble,
with its setting; but sometimes a reverse course may be aristocratic to remark,
to scan, and even to gape at, the mob (for preference, through a lorgnette),
even as though one were taking the crowd and its squalor for a sort of raree
show which had been organised specially for a gentleman’s diversion. Though
one may be squeezed by the crowd, one must look as though one were fully
assured of being the observer--of having neither part nor lot with the observed.
At the same time, to stare fixedly about one is unbecoming; for that, again, is
ungentlemanly, seeing that no spectacle is worth an open stare--are no
spectacles in the world which merit from a gentleman too pronounced an
inspection.
However, to me personally the scene DID seem to be worth undisguised 
15
contemplation--more especially in view of the fact that I had come there not
only to look at, but also to number myself sincerely and wholeheartedly with,
the mob. As for my secret moral views, I had no room for them amongst my
actual, practical opinions. Let that stand as written: I am writing only to relieve
my conscience. Yet let me say also this: that from the first I have been
consistent in having an intense aversion to any trial of my acts and thoughts by
a moral standard. Another standard altogether has directed my life. . . .
As a matter of fact, the mob was playing in exceedingly foul fashion. Indeed, I
have an idea that sheer robbery was going on around that gaming-table. The
croupiers who sat at the two ends of it had not only to watch the stakes, but
also to calculate the game--an immense amount of work for two men! As for
the crowd itself--well, it consisted mostly of Frenchmen. Yet I was not then
taking notes merely in order to be able to give you a description of roulette, but
in order to get my bearings as to my behaviour when I myself should begin to
play. For example, I noticed that nothing was more common than for another’s
hand to stretch out and grab one’s winnings whenever one had won. Then
there would arise a dispute, and frequently an uproar; and it would be a case of
“I beg of you to prove, and to produce witnesses to the fact, that the stake is
yours.”
At first the proceedings were pure Greek to me. I could only divine and
distinguish that stakes were hazarded on numbers, on “odd” or “even,” and on
colours. Polina’s money I decided to risk, that evening, only to the amount of
100 gulden. The thought that I was not going to play for myself quite unnerved
me. It was an unpleasant sensation, and I tried hard to banish it. I had a
feeling that, once I had begun to play for Polina, I should wreck my own
fortunes. Also, I wonder if any one has EVER approached a gaming-table
without falling an immediate prey to superstition? I began by pulling out fifty
gulden, and staking them on “even.” The wheel spun and stopped at 13. I had
lost! With a feeling like a sick qualm, as though I would like to make my way
out of the crowd and go home, I staked another fifty gulden--this time on the
red. The red turned up. Next time I staked the 100 gulden just where they
lay--and again the red turned up. Again I staked the whole sum, and again the
red turned up. Clutching my 400 gulden, I placed 200 of them on twelve
16
figures, to see what would come of it. The result was that the croupier paid me
out three times my total stake! Thus from 100 gulden my store had grown to
800! Upon that such a curious, such an inexplicable, unwonted feeling
overcame me that I decided to depart. Always the thought kept recurring to me
that if I had been playing for myself alone I should never have had such luck.
Once more I staked the whole 800 gulden on the “even.” The wheel stopped at
4. I was paid out another 800 gulden, and, snatching up my pile of 1600,
departed in search of Polina Alexandrovna.
I found the whole party walking in the park, and was able to get an interview
with her only after supper. This time the Frenchman was absent from the meal,
and the General seemed to be in a more expansive vein. Among other things,
he thought it necessary to remind me that he would be sorry to see me playing
at the gaming-tables. In his opinion, such conduct would greatly compromise
him--especially if I were to lose much. “ And even if you were to WIN much I
should be compromised,” he added in a meaning sort of way. “Of course I have
no RIGHT to order your actions, but you yourself will agree that...” As usual, he
did not finish his sentence. I answered drily that I had very little money in my
possession, and that, consequently, I was hardly in a position to indulge in any
conspicuous play, even if I did gamble. At last, when ascending to my own
room, I succeeded in handing Polina her winnings, and told her that, next time,
I should not play for her.
“Why not?” she asked excitedly.
“Because I wish to play FOR MYSELF,” I replied with a feigned glance of
astonishment. “That is my sole reason.”
“Then are you so certain that your roulette-playing will get us out of our
difficulties?” she inquired with a quizzical smile.
I said very seriously, “Yes,” and then added: “Possibly my certainty about
winning may seem to you ridiculous; yet, pray leave me in peace.”
Nonetheless she insisted that I ought to go halves with her in the day’s
winnings, and offered me 800 gulden on condition that henceforth, I gambled
only on those terms; but I refused to do so, once and for all--stating, as my
17
reason, that I found myself unable to play on behalf of any one else, “I am not
unwilling so to do,” I added, “but in all probability I should lose.”
“Well, absurd though it be, I place great hopes on your playing of roulette,” she
remarked musingly; “wherefore, you ought to play as my partner and on equal
shares; wherefore, of course, you will do as I wish.”
Then she left me without listening to any further protests on my part.
III
On the morrow she said not a word to me about gambling. In fact, she
purposely avoided me, although her old manner to me had not changed: the
same serene coolness was hers on meeting me -- a coolness that was mingled
even with a spice of contempt and dislike. In short, she was at no pains to
conceal her aversion to me. That I could see plainly. Also, she did not trouble
to conceal from me the fact that I was necessary to her, and that she was
keeping me for some end which she had in view. Consequently there became
established between us relations which, to a large extent, were
incomprehensible to me, considering her general pride and aloofness. For
example, although she knew that I was madly in love with her, she allowed me
to speak to her of my passion (though she could not well have showed her
contempt for me more than by permitting me, unhindered and unrebuked, to
mention to her my love).
“You see,” her attitude expressed, “how little I regard your feelings, as well as
how little I care for what you say to me, or for what you feel for me.” Likewise,
though she spoke as before concerning her affairs, it was never with complete
frankness. In her contempt for me there were refinements. Although she knew
well that I was aware of a certain circumstance in her life of something which
might one day cause her trouble, she would speak to me about her affairs
(whenever she had need of me for a given end) as though I were a slave or a
passing acquaintance--yet tell them me only in so far as one would need to
know them if one were going to be made temporary use of. Had I not known
the whole chain of events, or had she not seen how much I was pained and
disturbed by her teasing insistency, she would never have thought it worthwhile
18
to soothe me with this frankness--even though, since she not infrequently used
me to execute commissions that were not only troublesome, but risky, she
ought, in my opinion, to have been frank in ANY case. But, forsooth, it was not
worth her while to trouble about MY feelings--about the fact that I was uneasy,
and, perhaps, thrice as put about by her cares and misfortunes as she was
herself!
For three weeks I had known of her intention to take to roulette. She had even
warned me that she would like me to play on her behalf, since it was
unbecoming for her to play in person; and, from the tone of her words I had
gathered that there was something on her mind besides a mere desire to win
money. As if money could matter to HER! No, she had some end in view, and
there were circumstances at which I could guess, but which I did not know for
certain. True, the slavery and abasement in which she held me might have
given me (such things often do so) the power to question her with abrupt
directness (seeing that, inasmuch as I figured in her eyes as a mere slave and
nonentity, she could not very well have taken offence at any rude curiosity);
but the fact was that, though she let me question her, she never returned me a
single answer, and at times did not so much as notice me. That is how matters
stood.
Next day there was a good deal of talk about a telegram which, four days ago,
had been sent to St. Petersburg, but to which there had come no answer. The
General was visibly disturbed and moody, for the matter concerned his mother.
The Frenchman, too, was excited, and after dinner the whole party talked long
and seriously together--the Frenchman’s tone being extraordinarily
presumptuous and offhand to everybody. It almost reminded one of the
proverb, “Invite a man to your table, and soon he will place his feet upon it.”
Even to Polina he was brusque almost to the point of rudeness. Yet still he
seemed glad to join us in our walks in the Casino, or in our rides and drives
about the town. I had long been aware of certain circumstances which bound
the General to him; I had long been aware that in Russia they had hatched
some scheme together although I did not know whether the plot had come to
anything, or whether it was still only in the stage of being talked of. Likewise I
was aware, in part, of a family secret--namely, that, last year, the Frenchman
19
had bailed the General out of debt, and given him 30,000 roubles wherewith to
pay his Treasury dues on retiring from the service. And now, of course, the
General was in a vice -- although the chief part in the affair was being played
by Mlle. Blanche. Yes, of this last I had no doubt.
But WHO was this Mlle. Blanche? It was said of her that she was a
Frenchwoman of good birth who, living with her mother, possessed a colossal
fortune. It was also said that she was some relation to the Marquis, but only a
distant one a cousin, or cousin-german, or something of the sort. Likewise I
knew that, up to the time of my journey to Paris, she and the Frenchman had
been more ceremonious towards our party--they had stood on a much more
precise and delicate footing with them; but that now their
acquaintanceship--their friendship, their intimacy--had taken on a much more
off-hand and rough-and-ready air. Perhaps they thought that our means were
too modest for them, and, therefore, unworthy of politeness or reticence. Also,
for the last three days I had noticed certain looks which Astley had kept
throwing at Mlle. Blanche and her mother; and it had occurred to me that he
must have had some previous acquaintance with the pair. I had even surmised
that the Frenchman too must have met Mr. Astley before. Astley was a man so
shy, reserved, and taciturn in his manner that one might have looked for
anything from him. At all events the Frenchman accorded him only the slightest
of greetings, and scarcely even looked at him. Certainly he did not seem to be
afraid of him; which was intelligible enough. But why did Mlle. Blanche also
never look at the Englishman?--particularly since, a propos of something or
another, the Marquis had declared the Englishman to be immensely and
indubitably rich? Was not that a sufficient reason to make Mlle. Blanche look at
the Englishman? Anyway the General seemed extremely uneasy; and, one
could well understand what a telegram to announce the death of his mother
would mean for him!
Although I thought it probable that Polina was avoiding me for a definite
reason, I adopted a cold and indifferent air; for I felt pretty certain that it
would not be long before she herself approached me. For two days, therefore, I
devoted my attention to Mlle. Blanche. The poor General was in despair! To fall
in love at fifty-five, and with such vehemence, is indeed a misfortune! And add
20
to that his widowerhood, his children, his ruined property, his debts, and the
woman with whom he had fallen in love! Though Mlle. Blanche was extremely
good-looking, I may or may not be understood when I say that she had one of
those faces which one is afraid of. At all events, I myself have always feared
such women. Apparently about twenty-five years of age, she was tall and
broad-shouldered, with shoulders that sloped; yet though her neck and bosom
were ample in their proportions, her skin was dull yellow in colour, while her
hair (which was extremely abundant--sufficient to make two coiffures) was as
black as Indian ink. Add to that a pair of black eyes with yellowish whites, a
proud glance, gleaming teeth, and lips which were perennially pomaded and
redolent of musk. As for her dress, it was invariably rich, effective, and chic,
yet in good taste. Lastly, her feet and hands were astonishing, and her voice a
deep contralto. Sometimes, when she laughed, she displayed her teeth, but at
ordinary times her air was taciturn and haughty--especially in the presence of
Polina and Maria Philipovna. Yet she seemed to me almost destitute of
education, and even of wits, though cunning and suspicious. This, apparently,
was not because her life had been lacking in incident. Perhaps, if all were
known, the Marquis was not her kinsman at all, nor her mother, her mother;
but there was evidence that, in Berlin, where we had first come across the pair,
they had possessed acquaintances of good standing. As for the Marquis himself,
I doubt to this day if he was a Marquis--although about the fact that he had
formerly belonged to high society (for instance, in Moscow and Germany) there
could be no doubt whatever. What he had formerly been in France I had not a
notion. All I knew was that he was said to possess a chateau. During the last
two weeks I had looked for much to transpire, but am still ignorant whether at
that time anything decisive ever passed between Mademoiselle and the
General. Everything seemed to depend upon our means--upon whether the
General would be able to flourish sufficient money in her face. If ever the news
should arrive that the grandmother was not dead, Mlle. Blanche, I felt sure,
would disappear in a twinkling. Indeed, it surprised and amused me to observe
what a passion for intrigue I was developing. But how I loathed it all! With what
pleasure would I have given everybody and everything the go-by! Only--I could
not leave Polina. How, then, could I show contempt for those who surrounded
her? Espionage is a base thing, but--what have I to do with that?
21
Mr. Astley, too, I found a curious person. I was only sure that he had fallen in
love With Polina. A remarkable and diverting circumstance is the amount which
may lie in the mien of a shy and painfully modest man who has been touched
with the divine passion--especially when he would rather sink into the earth
than betray himself by a single word or look. Though Mr. Astley frequently met
us when we were out walking, he would merely take off his hat and pass us by,
though I knew he was dying to join us. Even when invited to do so, he would
refuse. Again, in places of amusement--in the Casino, at concerts, or near the
fountain--he was never far from the spot where we were sitting. In fact,
WHEREVER we were in the Park, in the forest, or on the Shlangenberg--one
needed but to raise one’s eyes and glance around to catch sight of at least a
PORTION of Mr. Astley’s frame sticking out--whether on an adjacent path or
behind a bush. Yet never did he lose any chance of speaking to myself; and,
one morning when we had met, and exchanged a couple of words, he burst out
in his usual abrupt way, without saying “Good-morning.”
“That Mlle. Blanche,” he said. “Well, I have seen a good many women like her.”
After that he was silent as he looked me meaningly in the face. What he meant
I did not know, but to my glance of inquiry he returned only a dry nod, and a
reiterated “It is so.” Presently, however, he resumed:
“Does Mlle. Polina like flowers?”
“ I really cannot say,” was my reply.
“What? You cannot say?” he cried in great astonishment.
“No; I have never noticed whether she does so or not,” I repeated with a smile.
“Hm! Then I have an idea in my mind,” he concluded. Lastly, with a nod, he
walked away with a pleased expression on his face. The conversation had been
carried on in execrable French.
IV
Today has been a day of folly, stupidity, and ineptness. The time is now eleven
o’clock in the evening, and I am sitting in my room and thinking. It all began,
22
this morning, with my being forced to go and play roulette for Polina
Alexandrovna. When she handed me over her store of six hundred gulden I
exacted two conditions --namely, that I should not go halves with her in her
winnings, if any (that is to say, I should not take anything for myself), and that
she should explain to me, that same evening, why it was so necessary for her
to win, and how much was the sum which she needed. For, I could not suppose
that she was doing all this merely for the sake of money. Yet clearly she did
need some money, and that as soon as possible, and for a special purpose.
Well, she promised to explain matters, and I departed. There was a
tremendous crowd in the gaming-rooms. What an arrogant, greedy crowd it
was! I pressed forward towards the middle of the room until I had secured a
seat at a croupier’s elbow. Then I began to play in timid fashion, venturing only
twenty or thirty gulden at a time. Meanwhile, I observed and took notes. It
seemed to me that calculation was superfluous, and by no means possessed of
the importance which certain other players attached to it, even though they sat
with ruled papers in their hands, whereon they set down the coups, calculated
the chances, reckoned, staked, and--lost exactly as we more simple mortals did
who played without any reckoning at all.
However, I deduced from the scene one conclusion which seemed to me
reliable --namely, that in the flow of fortuitous chances there is, if not a
system, at all events a sort of order. This, of course, is a very strange thing.
For instance, after a dozen middle figures there would always occur a dozen or
so outer ones. Suppose the ball stopped twice at a dozen outer figures; it
would then pass to a dozen of the first ones, and then, again, to a dozen of the
middle ciphers, and fall upon them three or four times, and then revert to a
dozen outers; whence, after another couple of rounds, the ball would again
pass to the first figures, strike upon them once, and then return thrice to the
middle series--continuing thus for an hour and a half, or two hours. One, three,
two: one, three, two. It was all very curious. Again, for the whole of a day or a
morning the red would alternate with the black, but almost without any order,
and from moment to moment, so that scarcely two consecutive rounds would
end upon either the one or the other. Yet, next day, or, perhaps, the next
evening, the red alone would turn up, and attain a run of over two score, and
23
continue so for quite a length of time--say, for a whole day. Of these
circumstances the majority were pointed out to me by Mr. Astley, who stood by
the gaming-table the whole morning, yet never once staked in person.
For myself, I lost all that I had on me, and with great speed. To begin with, I
staked two hundred gulden on “ even,” and won. Then I staked the same
amount again, and won: and so on some two or three times. At one moment I
must have had in my hands--gathered there within a space of five
minutes--about 4000 gulden. That, of course, was the proper moment for me
to have departed, but there arose in me a strange sensation as of a challenge
to Fate--as of a wish to deal her a blow on the cheek, and to put out my tongue
at her. Accordingly I set down the largest stake allowed by the rules--namely,
4000 gulden--and lost. Fired by this mishap, I pulled out all the money left to
me, staked it all on the same venture, and--again lost! Then I rose from the
table, feeling as though I were stupefied. What had happened to me I did not
know; but, before luncheon I told Polina of my losses-- until which time I
walked about the Park.
At luncheon I was as excited as I had been at the meal three days ago. Mlle.
Blanche and the Frenchman were lunching with us, and it appeared that the
former had been to the Casino that morning, and had seen my exploits there.
So now she showed me more attention when talking to me; while, for his part,
the Frenchman approached me, and asked outright if it had been my own
money that I had lost. He appeared to be suspicious as to something being on
foot between Polina and myself, but I merely fired up, and replied that the
money had been all my own.
At this the General seemed extremely surprised, and asked me whence I had
procured it; whereupon I replied that, though I had begun only with 100
gulden, six or seven rounds had increased my capital to 5000 or 6000 gulden,
and that subsequently I had lost the whole in two rounds.
All this, of course, was plausible enough. During my recital I glanced at Polina,
but nothing was to be discerned on her face. However, she had allowed me to
fire up without correcting me, and from that I concluded that it was my cue to
fire up, and to conceal the fact that I had been playing on her behalf. “At all
24
events,” I thought to myself, “she, in her turn, has promised to give me an
explanation to-night, and to reveal to me something or another.”
Although the General appeared to be taking stock of me, he said nothing. Yet I
could see uneasiness and annoyance in his face. Perhaps his straitened
circumstances made it hard for him to have to hear of piles of gold passing
through the hands of an irresponsible fool like myself within the space of a
quarter of an hour. Now, I have an idea that, last night, he and the Frenchman
had a sharp encounter with one another. At all events they closeted themselves
together, and then had a long and vehement discussion; after which the
Frenchman departed in what appeared to be a passion, but returned, early this
morning, to renew the combat. On hearing of my losses, however, he only
remarked with a sharp, and even a malicious, air that “a man ought to go more
carefully.” Next, for some reason or another, he added that, “though a great
many Russians go in for gambling, they are no good at the game.”
“I think that roulette was devised specially for Russians,” I retorted; and when
the Frenchman smiled contemptuously at my reply I further remarked that I
was sure I was right; also that, speaking of Russians in the capacity of
gamblers, I had far more blame for them than praise--of that he could be quite
sure.
“Upon what do you base your opinion?” he inquired.
“Upon the fact that to the virtues and merits of the civilised Westerner there
has become historically added--though this is not his chief point--a capacity for
acquiring capital; whereas, not only is the Russian incapable of acquiring
capital, but also he exhausts it wantonly and of sheer folly. None the less we
Russians often need money; wherefore, we are glad of, and greatly devoted to,
a method of acquisition like roulette--whereby, in a couple of hours, one may
grow rich without doing any work. This method, I repeat, has a great attraction
for us, but since we play in wanton fashion, and without taking any trouble, we
almost invariably lose.”
“To a certain extent that is true,” assented the Frenchman with a self-satisfied
air.
25
“Oh no, it is not true,” put in the General sternly. “And you,” he added to me,
“you ought to be ashamed of yourself for traducing your own country!”
“I beg pardon,” I said. “Yet it would be difficult to say which is the worst of the
two--Russian ineptitude or the German method of growing rich through honest
toil.”
“What an extraordinary idea,” cried the General.
“And what a RUSSIAN idea!” added the Frenchman.
I smiled, for I was rather glad to have a quarrel with them.
“I would rather live a wandering life in tents,” I cried, “than bow the knee to a
German idol!”
“To WHAT idol?” exclaimed the General, now seriously angry.
“To the German method of heaping up riches. I have not been here very long,
but I can tell you that what I have seen and verified makes my Tartar blood
boil. Good Lord! I wish for no virtues of that kind. Yesterday I went for a walk
of about ten versts; and, everywhere I found that things were even as we read
of them in good German picture-books -- that every house has its ‘Fater,’ who
is horribly beneficent and extraordinarily honourable. So honourable is he that
it is dreadful to have anything to do with him; and I cannot bear people of that
sort. Each such ‘Fater’ has his family, and in the evenings they read improving
books aloud. Over their roof-trees there murmur elms and chestnuts; the sun
has sunk to his rest; a stork is roosting on the gable; and all is beautifully
poetic and touching. Do not be angry, General. Let me tell you something that
is even more touching than that. I can remember how, of an evening, my own
father, now dead, used to sit under the lime trees in his little garden, and to
read books aloud to myself and my mother. Yes, I know how things ought to be
done. Yet every German family is bound to slavery and to submission to its
‘Fater.’ They work like oxen, and amass wealth like Jews. Suppose the ‘Fater’
has put by a certain number of gulden which he hands over to his eldest son, in
order that the said son may acquire a trade or a small plot of land. Well, one
result is to deprive the daughter of a dowry, and so leave her among the
26
unwedded. For the same reason, the parents will have to sell the younger son
into bondage or the ranks of the army, in order that he may earn more towards
the family capital. Yes, such things ARE done, for I have been making inquiries
on the subject. It is all done out of sheer rectitude--out of a rectitude which is
magnified to the point of the younger son believing that he has been RIGHTLY
sold, and that it is simply idyllic for the victim to rejoice when he is made over
into pledge. What more have I to tell? Well, this--that matters bear just as
hardly upon the eldest son. Perhaps he has his Gretchen to whom his heart is
bound; but he cannot marry her, for the reason that he has not yet amassed
sufficient gulden. So, the pair wait on in a mood of sincere and virtuous
expectation, and smilingly deposit themselves in pawn the while. Gretchen’s
cheeks grow sunken, and she begins to wither; until at last, after some twenty
years, their substance has multiplied, and sufficient gulden have been
honourably and virtuously accumulated. Then the ‘Fater’ blesses his
forty-year-old heir and the thirty-five-year-old Gretchen with the sunken bosom
and the scarlet nose; after which he bursts, into tears, reads the pair a lesson
on morality, and dies. In turn the eldest son becomes a virtuous ‘Fater,’ and
the old story begins again. In fifty or sixty years’ time the grandson of the
original ‘Fater’ will have amassed a considerable sum; and that sum he will
hand over to, his son, and the latter to HIS son, and so on for several
generations; until at length there will issue a Baron Rothschild, or a ‘Hoppe and
Company,’ or the devil knows what! Is it not a beautiful spectacle--the
spectacle of a century or two of inherited labour, patience, intellect, rectitude,
character, perseverance, and calculation, with a stork sitting on the roof above
it all? What is more; they think there can never be anything better than this;
wherefore, from their point of view they begin to judge the rest of the world,
and to censure all who are at fault--that is to say, who are not exactly like
themselves. Yes, there you have it in a nutshell. For my own part, I would
rather grow fat after the Russian manner, or squander my whole substance at
roulette. I have no wish to be ‘Hoppe and Company’ at the end of five
generations. I want the money for MYSELF, for in no way do I look upon my
personality as necessary to, or meet to be given over to, capital. I may be
wrong, but there you have it. Those are MY views.”
27
“How far you may be right in what you have said I do not know,” remarked the
General moodily; “but I DO know that you are becoming an insufferable farceur
whenever you are given the least chance.”
As usual, he left his sentence unfinished. Indeed, whenever he embarked upon
anything that in the least exceeded the limits of daily small-talk, he left
unfinished what he was saying. The Frenchman had listened to me
contemptuously, with a slight protruding of his eyes; but, he could not have
understood very much of my harangue. As for Polina, she had looked on with
serene indifference. She seemed to have heard neither my voice nor any other
during the progress of the meal.
V
Yes, she had been extraordinarily meditative. Yet, on leaving the table, she
immediately ordered me to accompany her for a walk. We took the children
with us, and set out for the fountain in the Park.
I was in such an irritated frame of mind that in rude and abrupt fashion I
blurted out a question as to “why our Marquis de Griers had ceased to
accompany her for strolls, or to speak to her for days together.”
“Because he is a brute,” she replied in rather a curious way. It was the first
time that I had heard her speak so of De Griers: consequently, I was
momentarily awed into silence by this expression of resentment.
“Have you noticed, too, that today he is by no means on good terms with the
General?” I went on.
“Yes-- and I suppose you want to know why,” she replied with dry
captiousness. “You are aware, are you not, that the General is mortgaged to
the Marquis, with all his property? Consequently, if the General’s mother does
not die, the Frenchman will become the absolute possessor of everything which
he now holds only in pledge.”
“Then it is really the case that everything is mortgaged? I have heard rumours
to that effect, but was unaware how far they might be true.”
28
“Yes, they ARE true. What then?”
“Why, it will be a case of ‘Farewell, Mlle. Blanche,’” I remarked; “for in such an
event she would never become Madame General. Do you know, I believe the
old man is so much in love with her that he will shoot himself if she should
throw him over. At his age it is a dangerous thing to fall in love.”
“Yes, something, I believe, WILL happen to him,” assented Polina thoughtfully.
“And what a fine thing it all is!” I continued. “Could anything be more
abominable than the way in which she has agreed to marry for money alone?
Not one of the decencies has been observed; the whole affair has taken place
without the least ceremony. And as for the grandmother, what could be more
comical, yet more dastardly, than the sending of telegram after telegram to
know if she is dead? What do you think of it, Polina Alexandrovna?”
“Yes, it is very horrible,” she interrupted with a shudder. “Consequently, I am
the more surprised that YOU should be so cheerful. What are YOU so pleased
about? About the fact that you have gone and lost my money?”
“What? The money that you gave me to lose? I told you I should never win for
other people--least of all for you. I obeyed you simply because you ordered me
to; but you must not blame me for the result. I warned you that no good would
ever come of it. You seem much depressed at having lost your money. Why do
you need it so greatly?”
“Why do YOU ask me these questions?”
“Because you promised to explain matters to me. Listen. I am certain that, as
soon as ever I ‘begin to play for myself’ (and I still have 120 gulden left), I
shall win. You can then take of me what you require.”
She made a contemptuous grimace.
“You must not be angry with me,” I continued, “for making such a proposal. I
am so conscious of being only a nonentity in your eyes that you need not mind
accepting money from me. A gift from me could not possibly offend you.
Moreover, it was I who lost your gulden.”
29
She glanced at me, but, seeing that I was in an irritable, sarcastic mood,
changed the subject.
“My affairs cannot possibly interest you,” she said. Still, if you DO wish to
know, I am in debt. I borrowed some money, and must pay it back again. I
have a curious, senseless idea that I am bound to win at the gaming-tables.
Why I think so I cannot tell, but I do think so, and with some assurance.
Perhaps it is because of that assurance that I now find myself without any
other resource.”
“Or perhaps it is because it is so NECESSARY for you to win. It is like a
drowning man catching at a straw. You yourself will agree that, unless he were
drowning he would not mistake a straw for the trunk of a tree.”
Polina looked surprised.
“What?” she said. “Do not you also hope something from it? Did you not tell me
again and again, two weeks ago, that you were certain of winning at roulette if
you played here? And did you not ask me not to consider you a fool for doing
so? Were you joking? You cannot have been, for I remember that you spoke
with a gravity which forbade the idea of your jesting.”
“True,” I replied gloomily. “I always felt certain that I should win. Indeed, what
you say makes me ask myself--Why have my absurd, senseless losses of today
raised a doubt in my mind? Yet I am still positive that, so soon as ever I begin
to play for myself, I shall infallibly win.”
“And why are you so certain?”
“To tell the truth, I do not know. I only know that I must win--that it is the one
resource I have left. Yes, why do I feel so assured on the point?”
“Perhaps because one cannot help winning if one is fanatically certain of doing
so.”
“Yet I dare wager that you do not think me capable of serious feeling in the
matter?”
“I do not care whether you are so or not,” answered Polina with calm
30
indifference. “Well, since you ask me, I DO doubt your ability to take anything
seriously. You are capable of worrying, but not deeply. You are too ill-regulated
and unsettled a person for that. But why do you want money? Not a single one
of the reasons which you have given can be looked upon as serious.”
“By the way,” I interrupted, “you say you want to pay off a debt. It must be a
large one. Is it to the Frenchman?”
“What do you mean by asking all these questions? You are very clever today.
Surely you are not drunk?”
“You know that you and I stand on no ceremony, and that sometimes I put to
you very plain questions. I repeat that I am your, slave--and slaves cannot be
shamed or offended.”
“You talk like a child. It is always possible to comport oneself with dignity. If
one has a quarrel it ought to elevate rather than to degrade one.”
“A maxim straight from the copybook! Suppose I CANNOT comport myself with
dignity. By that I mean that, though I am a man of self-respect, I am unable to
carry off a situation properly. Do you know the reason? It is because we
Russians are too richly and multifariously gifted to be able at once to find the
proper mode of expression. It is all a question of mode. Most of us are so
bounteously endowed with intellect as to require also a spice of genius to
choose the right form of behaviour. And genius is lacking in us for the reason
that so little genius at all exists. It belongs only to the French--though a few
other Europeans have elaborated their forms so well as to be able to figure with
extreme dignity, and yet be wholly undignified persons. That is why, with us,
the mode is so all-important. The Frenchman may receive an insult-- a real, a
venomous insult: yet, he will not so much as frown. But a tweaking of the nose
he cannot bear, for the reason that such an act is an infringement of the
accepted, of the time-hallowed order of decorum. That is why our good ladies
are so fond of Frenchmen--the Frenchman’s manners, they say, are perfect!
But in my opinion there is no such thing as a Frenchman’s manners. The
Frenchman is only a bird--the coq gaulois. At the same time, as I am not a
woman, I do not properly understand the question. Cocks may be excellent
31
birds. If I am wrong you must stop me. You ought to stop and correct me more
often when I am speaking to you, for I am too apt to say everything that is in
my head.
“You see, I have lost my manners. I agree that I have none, nor yet any
dignity. I will tell you why. I set no store upon such things. Everything in me
has undergone a cheek. You know the reason. I have not a single human
thought in my head. For a long while I have been ignorant of what is going on
in the world--here or in Russia. I have been to Dresden, yet am completely in
the dark as to what Dresden is like. You know the cause of my obsession. I
have no hope now, and am a mere cipher in your eyes; wherefore, I tell you
outright that wherever I go I see only you--all the rest is a matter of
indifference.
“Why or how I have come to love you I do not know. It may be that you are
not altogether fair to look upon. Do you know, I am ignorant even as to what
your face is like. In all probability, too, your heart is not comely, and it is
possible that your mind is wholly ignoble.”
“And because you do not believe in my nobility of soul you think to purchase
me with money?” she said.
“WHEN have I thought to do so?” was my reply.
“You are losing the thread of the argument. If you do not wish to purchase me,
at all events you wish to purchase my respect.”
“Not at all. I have told you that I find it difficult to explain myself. You are hard
upon me. Do not be angry at my chattering. You know why you ought not to be
angry with me--that I am simply an imbecile. However, I do not mind if you
ARE angry. Sitting in my room, I need but to think of you, to imagine to myself
the rustle of your dress, and at once I fall almost to biting my hands. Why
should you be angry with me? Because I call myself your slave? Revel, I pray
you, in my slavery--revel in it. Do you know that sometimes I could kill
you?--not because I do not love you, or am jealous of you, but, because I feel
as though I could simply devour you... You are laughing!”
32
“No, I am not,” she retorted. “But I order you, nevertheless, to be silent.”
She stopped, well nigh breathless with anger. God knows, she may not have
been a beautiful woman, yet I loved to see her come to a halt like this, and was
therefore, the more fond of arousing her temper. Perhaps she divined this, and
for that very reason gave way to rage. I said as much to her.
“What rubbish!” she cried with a shudder.
“I do not care,” I continued. “Also, do you know that it is not safe for us to take
walks together? Often I have a feeling that I should like to strike you, to
disfigure you, to strangle you. Are you certain that it will never come to that?
You are driving me to frenzy. Am I afraid of a scandal, or of your anger? Why
should I fear your anger? I love without hope, and know that hereafter I shall
love you a thousand times more. If ever I should kill you I should have to kill
myself too. But I shall put off doing so as long as possible, for I wish to
continue enjoying the unbearable pain which your coldness gives me. Do you
know a very strange thing? It is that, with every day, my love for you
increases--though that would seem to be almost an impossibility. Why should I
not become a fatalist? Remember how, on the third day that we ascended the
Shlangenberg, I was moved to whisper in your ear: ‘Say but the word, and I
will leap into the abyss.’ Had you said it, I should have leapt. Do you not
believe me?”
“What stupid rubbish!” she cried.
“I care not whether it be wise or stupid,” I cried in return. “I only know that in
your presence I must speak, speak, speak. Therefore, I am speaking. I lose all
conceit when I am with you, and everything ceases to matter.”
“Why should I have wanted you to leap from the Shlangenberg?” she said drily,
and (I think) with wilful offensiveness. “THAT would have been of no use to
me.”
“Splendid!” I shouted. “I know well that you must have used the words ‘of no
use’ in order to crush me. I can see through you. ‘Of no use,’ did you say?
Why, to give pleasure is ALWAYS of use; and, as for barbarous, unlimited
33
power--even if it be only over a fly--why, it is a kind of luxury. Man is a despot
by nature, and loves to torture. You, in particular, love to do so.”
I remember that at this moment she looked at me in a peculiar way. The fact is
that my face must have been expressing all the maze of senseless, gross
sensations which were seething within me. To this day I can remember, word
for word, the conversation as I have written it down. My eyes were suffused
with blood, and the foam had caked itself on my lips. Also, on my honour I
swear that, had she bidden me cast myself from the summit of the
Shlangenberg, I should have done it. Yes, had she bidden me in jest, or only in
contempt and with a spit in my face, I should have cast myself down.
“Oh no! Why so? I believe you,” she said, but in such a manner--in the manner
of which, at times, she was a mistress--and with such a note of disdain and
viperish arrogance in her tone, that God knows I could have killed her.
Yes, at that moment she stood in peril. I had not lied to her about that.
“Surely you are not a coward?” suddenly she asked me.
“I do not know,” I replied. “Perhaps I am, but I do not know. I have long given
up thinking about such things.”
“If I said to you, ‘Kill that man,’ would you kill him?”
“Whom?”
“Whomsoever I wish?”
“The Frenchman?”
“Do not ask me questions; return me answers. I repeat, whomsoever I wish? I
desire to see if you were speaking seriously just now.”
She awaited my reply with such gravity and impatience that I found the
situation unpleasant.
“Do YOU, rather, tell me,” I said, “what is going on here? Why do you seem
half-afraid of me? I can see for myself what is wrong. You are the
step-daughter of a ruined and insensate man who is smitten with love for this
34
devil of a Blanche. And there is this Frenchman, too, with his mysterious
influence over you. Yet, you actually ask me such a question! If you do not tell
me how things stand, I shall have to put in my oar and do something. Are you
ashamed to be frank with me? Are you shy of me? “
”I am not going to talk to you on that subject. I have asked you a question,
and am waiting for an answer.”
“Well, then--I will kill whomsoever you wish,” I said. “But are you REALLY going
to bid me do such deeds?”
“Why should you think that I am going to let you off? I shall bid you do it, or
else renounce me. Could you ever do the latter? No, you know that you
couldn’t. You would first kill whom I had bidden you, and then kill ME for having
dared to send you away!”
Something seemed to strike upon my brain as I heard these words. Of course,
at the time I took them half in jest and half as a challenge; yet, she had
spoken them with great seriousness. I felt thunderstruck that she should so
express herself, that she should assert such a right over me, that she should
assume such authority and say outright: “Either you kill whom I bid you, or I
will have nothing more to do with you.” Indeed, in what she had said there was
something so cynical and unveiled as to pass all bounds. For how could she
ever regard me as the same after the killing was done? This was more than
slavery and abasement; it was sufficient to bring a man back to his right
senses. Yet, despite the outrageous improbability of our conversation, my heart
shook within me.
Suddenly, she burst out laughing. We were seated on a bench near the spot
where the children were playing--just opposite the point in the alley-way before
the Casino where the carriages drew up in order to set down their occupants.
“Do you see that fat Baroness?” she cried. “It is the Baroness Burmergelm. She
arrived three days ago. Just look at her husband--that tall, wizened Prussian
there, with the stick in his hand. Do you remember how he stared at us the
other day? Well, go to the Baroness, take off your hat to her, and say
something in French.”
35
“Why?”
“Because you have sworn that you would leap from the Shlangenberg for my
sake, and that you would kill any one whom I might bid you kill. Well, instead
of such murders and tragedies, I wish only for a good laugh. Go without
answering me, and let me see the Baron give you a sound thrashing with his
stick.”
“Then you throw me out a challenge?--you think that I will not do it?”
“Yes, I do challenge you. Go, for such is my will.”
“Then I WILL go, however mad be your fancy. Only, look here: shall you not be
doing the General a great disservice, as well as, through him, a great disservice
to yourself? It is not about myself I am worrying-- it is about you and the
General. Why, for a mere fancy, should I go and insult a woman?”
“Ah! Then I can see that you are only a trifler,” she said contemptuously. “Your
eyes are swimming with blood--but only because you have drunk a little too
much at luncheon. Do I not know that what I have asked you to do is foolish
and wrong, and that the General will be angry about it? But I want to have a
good laugh, all the same. I want that, and nothing else. Why should you insult
a woman, indeed? Well, you will be given a sound thrashing for so doing.”
I turned away, and went silently to do her bidding. Of course the thing was
folly, but I could not get out of it. I remember that, as I approached the
Baroness, I felt as excited as a schoolboy. I was in a frenzy, as though I were
drunk.
VI
Two days have passed since that day of lunacy. What a noise and a fuss and a
chattering and an uproar there was! And what a welter of unseemliness and
disorder and stupidity and bad manners! And I the cause of it all! Yet part of
the scene was also ridiculous--at all events to myself it was so. I am not quite
sure what was the matter with me--whether I was merely stupefied or whether
I purposely broke loose and ran amok. At times my mind seems all confused;
36
while at other times I seem almost to be back in my childhood, at the school
desk, and to have done the deed simply out of mischief.
It all came of Polina--yes, of Polina. But for her, there might never have been a
fracas. Or perhaps I did the deed in a fit of despair (though it may be foolish of
me to think so)? What there is so attractive about her I cannot think. Yet there
IS something attractive about her--something passing fair, it would seem.
Others besides myself she has driven to distraction. She is tall and straight,
and very slim. Her body looks as though it could be tied into a knot, or bent
double, like a cord. The imprint of her foot is long and narrow. It is, a
maddening imprint--yes, simply a maddening one! And her hair has a reddish
tint about it, and her eyes are like cat’s eyes--though able also to glance with
proud, disdainful mien. On the evening of my first arrival, four months ago, I
remember that she was sitting and holding an animated conversation with De
Griers in the salon. And the way in which she looked at him was such that later,
when I retired to my own room upstairs, I kept fancying that she had smitten
him in the face--that she had smitten him right on the cheek, so peculiar had
been her look as she stood confronting him. Ever since that evening I have
loved her.
But to my tale.
I stepped from the path into the carriage-way, and took my stand in the middle
of it. There I awaited the Baron and the Baroness. When they were but a few
paces distant from me I took off my hat, and bowed.
I remember that the Baroness was clad in a voluminous silk dress, pale grey in
colour, and adorned with flounces and a crinoline and train. Also, she was short
and inordinately stout, while her gross, flabby chin completely concealed her
neck. Her face was purple, and the little eyes in it had an impudent, malicious
expression. Yet she walked as though she were conferring a favour upon
everybody by so doing. As for the Baron, he was tall, wizened, bony-faced after
the German fashion, spectacled, and, apparently, about forty-five years of age.
Also, he had legs which seemed to begin almost at his chest--or, rather, at his
chin! Yet, for all his air of peacock-like conceit, his clothes sagged a little, and
his face wore a sheepish air which might have passed for profundity.
37
These details I noted within a space of a few seconds.
At first my bow and the fact that I had my hat in my hand barely caught their
attention. The Baron only scowled a little, and the Baroness swept straight on.
“Madame la Baronne,” said I, loudly and distinctly--embroidering each word, as
it were--“j’ai l’honneur d’etre votre esclave.”
Then I bowed again, put on my hat, and walked past the Baron with a rude
smile on my face.
Polina had ordered me merely to take off my hat: the bow and the general
effrontery were of my own invention. God knows what instigated me to
perpetrate the outrage! In my frenzy I felt as though I were walking on air,
“Hein!” ejaculated--or, rather, growled--the Baron as he turned towards me in
angry surprise.
I too turned round, and stood waiting in pseudo-courteous expectation. Yet still
I wore on my face an impudent smile as I gazed at him. He seemed to hesitate,
and his brows contracted to their utmost limits. Every moment his visage was
growing darker. The Baroness also turned in my direction, and gazed at me in
wrathful perplexity, while some of the passers-by also began to stare at us, and
others of them halted outright.
“Hein!” the Baron vociferated again, with a redoubled growl and a note of
growing wrath in his voice.
“Ja wohl!” I replied, still looking him in the eyes.
“Sind sie rasend?” he exclaimed, brandishing his stick, and, apparently,
beginning to feel nervous. Perhaps it was my costume which intimidated him,
for I was well and fashionably dressed, after the manner of a man who belongs
to indisputably good society.
“Ja wo-o-ohl!” cried I again with all my might with a longdrawn rolling of the “
ohl “ sound after the fashion of the Berliners (who constantly use the phrase
“Ja wohl!” in conversation, and more or less prolong the syllable “ohl” according
as they desire to express different shades of meaning or of mood).
38
At this the Baron and the Baroness faced sharply about, and almost fled in their
alarm. Some of the bystanders gave vent to excited exclamations, and others
remained staring at me in astonishment. But I do not remember the details
very well.
Wheeling quietly about, I returned in the direction of Polina Alexandrovna. But,
when I had got within a hundred paces of her seat, I saw her rise and set out
with the children towards the hotel.
At the portico I caught up to her.
“I have perpetrated the--the piece of idiocy,” I said as I came level with her.
“Have you? Then you can take the consequences,” she replied without so much
as looking at me. Then she moved towards the staircase.
I spent the rest of the evening walking in the park. Thence I passed into the
forest, and walked on until I found myself in a neighbouring principality. At a
wayside restaurant I partook of an omelette and some wine, and was charged
for the idyllic repast a thaler and a half.
Not until eleven o’clock did I return home--to find a summons awaiting me
from the General.
Our party occupied two suites in the hotel; each of which contained two rooms.
The first (the larger suite) comprised a salon and a smoking-room, with,
adjoining the latter, the General’s study. It was here that he was awaiting me
as he stood posed in a majestic attitude beside his writing-table. Lolling on a
divan close by was De Griers.
“My good sir,” the General began, “may I ask you what this is that you have
gone and done?”
“I should be glad,” I replied, “if we could come straight to the point. Probably
you are referring to my encounter of today with a German?”
“With a German? Why, the German was the Baron Burmergelm--a most
important personage! I hear that you have been rude both to him and to the
Baroness?”
39
“No, I have not.”
“But I understand that you simply terrified them, my good sir?” shouted the
General.
“Not in the least,” I replied. “You must know that when I was in Berlin I
frequently used to hear the Berliners repeat, and repellently prolong, a certain
phrase--namely, ‘Ja wohl!’; and, happening to meet this couple in the
carriage-drive, I found, for some reason or another, that this phrase suddenly
recurred to my memory, and exercised a rousing effect upon my spirits.
Moreover, on the three previous occasions that I have met the Baroness she
has walked towards me as though I were a worm which could easily be crushed
with the foot. Not unnaturally, I too possess a measure of self-respect;
wherefore, on THIS occasion I took off my hat, and said politely (yes, I assure
you it was said politely): ‘Madame, j’ai l’honneur d’etre votre esclave.’ Then the
Baron turned round, and said ‘Hein!’; whereupon I felt moved to ejaculate in
answer ‘Ja wohl!’ Twice I shouted it at him--the first time in an ordinary tone,
and the second time with the greatest prolonging of the words of which I was
capable. That is all.”
I must confess that this puerile explanation gave me great pleasure. I felt a
strong desire to overlay the incident with an even added measure of grossness;
so, the further I proceeded, the more did the gusto of my proceeding increase.
“You are only making fun of me! “ vociferated the General as, turning to the
Frenchman, he declared that my bringing about of the incident had been
gratuitous. De Griers smiled contemptuously, and shrugged his shoulders.
“Do not think THAT,” I put in. “It was not so at all. I grant you that my
behaviour was bad--I fully confess that it was so, and make no secret of the
fact. I would even go so far as to grant you that my behaviour might well be
called stupid and indecent tomfoolery; but, MORE than that it was not. Also, let
me tell you that I am very sorry for my conduct. Yet there is one circumstance
which, in my eyes, almost absolves me from regret in the matter. Of late--that
is to say, for the last two or three weeks--I have been feeling not at all well.
That is to say, I have been in a sick, nervous, irritable, fanciful condition, so
40
that I have periodically lost control over myself. For instance, on more than one
occasion I have tried to pick a quarrel even with Monsieur le Marquise here;
and, under the circumstances, he had no choice but to answer me. In short, I
have recently been showing signs of ill-health. Whether the Baroness
Burmergelm will take this circumstance into consideration when I come to beg
her pardon (for I do intend to make her amends) I do not know; but I doubt if
she will, and the less so since, so far as I know, the circumstance is one which,
of late, has begun to be abused in the legal world, in that advocates in criminal
cases have taken to justifying their clients on the ground that, at the moment
of the crime, they (the clients) were unconscious of what they were
doing--that, in short, they were out of health. ‘My client committed the
murder--that is true; but he has no recollection of having committed it.’ And
doctors actually support these advocates by affirming that there really is such a
malady--that there really can arise temporary delusions which make a man
remember nothing of a given deed, or only a half or a quarter of it! But the
Baron and Baroness are members of an older generation, as well as Prussian
Junkers and landowners. To them such a process in the medico-judicial world
will be unknown, and therefore, they are the more unlikely to accept any such
explanation. What is YOUR opinion about it, General?”
“Enough, sir! “ he thundered with barely restrained fury. “Enough, I say! Once
and for all I must endeavour to rid myself of you and your impertinence. To
justify yourself in the eyes of the Baron and Baroness will be impossible. Any
intercourse with you, even though it be confined to a begging of their pardons,
they would look upon as a degradation. I may tell you that, on learning that
you formed part of, my household, the Baron approached me in the Casino,
and demanded of me additional satisfaction. Do you understand, then, what it
is that you have entailed upon me--upon ME, my good sir? You have entailed
upon me the fact of my being forced to sue humbly to the Baron, and to give
him my word of honour that this very day you shall cease to belong to my
establishment!”
“Excuse me, General,” I interrupted, “but did he make an express point of it
that I should ‘cease to belong to your establishment,’ as you call it?”
41
“No; I, of my own initiative, thought that I ought to afford him that
satisfaction; and, with it he was satisfied. So we must part, good sir. It is my
duty to hand over to you forty gulden, three florins, as per the accompanying
statement. Here is the money, and here the account, which you are at liberty
to verify. Farewell. From henceforth we are strangers. From you I have never
had anything but trouble and unpleasantness. I am about to call the landlord,
and explain to him that from tomorrow onwards I shall no longer be responsible
for your hotel expenses. Also I have the honour to remain your obedient
servant.”
I took the money and the account (which was indicted in pencil), and, bowing
low to the General, said to him very gravely:
“The matter cannot end here. I regret very much that you should have been
put to unpleasantness at the Baron’s hands; but, the fault (pardon me) is your
own. How came you to answer for me to the Baron? And what did you mean by
saying that I formed part of your household? I am merely your family
tutor--not a son of yours, nor yet your ward, nor a person of any kind for
whose acts you need be responsible. I am a judicially competent person, a man
of twenty-five years of age, a university graduate, a gentleman, and, until I
met yourself, a complete stranger to you. Only my boundless respect for your
merits restrains me from demanding satisfaction at your hands, as well as a
further explanation as to the reasons which have led you to take it upon
yourself to answer for my conduct.”
So struck was he with my words that, spreading out his hands, he turned to the
Frenchman, and interpreted to him that I had challenged himself (the General)
to a duel. The Frenchman laughed aloud.
“Nor do I intend to let the Baron off,” I continued calmly, but with not a little
discomfiture at De Griers’ merriment. “And since you, General, have today
been so good as to listen to the Baron’s complaints, and to enter into his
concerns--since you have made yourself a participator in the affair--I have the
honour to inform you that, tomorrow morning at the latest, I shall, in my own
name, demand of the said Baron a formal explanation as to the reasons which
have led him to disregard the fact that the matter lies between him and myself
42
alone, and to put a slight upon me by referring it to another person, as though
I were unworthy to answer for my own conduct.”
Then there happened what I had foreseen. The General on hearing of this
further intended outrage, showed the white feather.
“What? “ he cried. “Do you intend to go on with this damned nonsense? Do you
not realise the harm that it is doing me? I beg of you not to laugh at me,
sir--not to laugh at me, for we have police authorities here who, out of respect
for my rank, and for that of the Baron... In short, sir, I swear to you that I will
have you arrested, and marched out of the place, to prevent any further
brawling on your part. Do you understand what I say?” He was almost
breathless with anger, as well as in a terrible fright.
“General,” I replied with that calmness which he never could abide, “one cannot
arrest a man for brawling until he has brawled. I have not so much as begun
my explanations to the Baron, and you are altogether ignorant as to the form
and time which my intended procedure is likely to assume. I wish but to
disabuse the Baron of what is, to me, a shameful supposition--namely, that I
am under the guardianship of a person who is qualified to exercise control over
my free will. It is vain for you to disturb and alarm yourself.”
“For God’s sake, Alexis Ivanovitch, do put an end to this senseless scheme of
yours!” he muttered, but with a sudden change from a truculent tone to one of
entreaty as he caught me by the hand. “Do you know what is likely to come of
it? Merely further unpleasantness. You will agree with me, I am sure, that at
present I ought to move with especial care--yes, with very especial care. You
cannot be fully aware of how I am situated. When we leave this place I shall be
ready to receive you back into my household; but, for the time being I-- Well, I
cannot tell you all my reasons.” With that he wound up in a despairing voice: “
O Alexis Ivanovitch, Alexis Ivanovitch!”
I moved towards the door--begging him to be calm, and promising that
everything should be done decently and in order; whereafter I departed.
Russians, when abroad, are over-apt to play the poltroon, to watch all their
words, and to wonder what people are thinking of their conduct, or whether
43
such and such a thing is ‘comme il faut.’ In short, they are over-apt to cosset
themselves, and to lay claim to great importance. Always they prefer the form
of behaviour which has once and for all become accepted and established. This
they will follow slavishly whether in hotels, on promenades, at meetings, or
when on a journey. But the General had avowed to me that, over and above
such considerations as these, there were circumstances which compelled him to
“move with especial care at present”, and that the fact had actually made him
poor-spirited and a coward--it had made him altogether change his tone
towards me. This fact I took into my calculations, and duly noted it, for, of
course, he MIGHT apply to the authorities tomorrow, and it behoved me to go
carefully.
Yet it was not the General but Polina that I wanted to anger. She had treated
me with such cruelty, and had got me into such a hole, that I felt a longing to
force her to beseech me to stop. Of course, my tomfoolery might compromise
her; yet certain other feelings and desires had begun to form themselves in my
brain. If I was never to rank in her eyes as anything but a nonentity, it would
not greatly matter if I figured as a draggle-tailed cockerel, and the Baron were
to give me a good thrashing; but, the fact was that I desired to have the laugh
of them all, and to come out myself unscathed. Let people see what they
WOULD see. Let Polina, for once, have a good fright, and be forced to whistle
me to heel again. But, however much she might whistle, she should see that I
was at least no draggle-tailed cockerel!
...........................
I have just received a surprising piece of news. I have just met our
chambermaid on the stairs, and been informed by her that Maria Philipovna
departed today, by the night train, to stay with a cousin at Carlsbad. What can
that mean? The maid declares that Madame packed her trunks early in the day.
Yet how is it that no one else seems to have been aware of the circumstance?
Or is it that I have been the only person to be unaware of it? Also, the maid
has just told me that, three days ago, Maria Philipovna had some high words
with the General. I understand, then! Probably the words were concerning Mlle.
Blanche. Certainly something decisive is approaching.
44
VII
In the morning I sent for the maitre d’hotel, and explained to him that, in
future, my bill was to be rendered to me personally. As a matter of fact, my
expenses had never been so large as to alarm me, nor to lead me to quit the
hotel; while, moreover, I still had 16o gulden left to me, and--in them--yes, in
them, perhaps, riches awaited me. It was a curious fact, that, though I had not
yet won anything at play, I nevertheless acted, thought, and felt as though I
were sure, before long, to become wealthy-- since I could not imagine myself
otherwise.
Next, I bethought me, despite the earliness of the hour, of going to see Mr.
Astley, who was staying at the Hotel de l’Angleterre (a hostelry at no great
distance from our own). But suddenly De Griers entered my room. This had
never before happened, for of late that gentleman and I had stood on the most
strained and distant of terms--he attempting no concealment of his contempt
for me (he even made an express, point of showing it), and I having no reason
to desire his company. In short, I detested him. Consequently, his entry at the
present moment the more astounded me. At once I divined that something out
of the way was on the carpet.
He entered with marked affability, and began by complimenting me on my
room. Then, perceiving that I had my hat in my hands, he inquired whither I
was going so early; and, no sooner did he hear that I was bound for Mr.
Astley’s than he stopped, looked grave, and seemed plunged in thought.
He was a true Frenchman insofar as that, though he could be lively and
engaging when it suited him, he became insufferably dull and wearisome as
soon as ever the need for being lively and engaging had passed. Seldom is a
Frenchman NATURALLY civil: he is civil only as though to order and of set
purpose. Also, if he thinks it incumbent upon him to be fanciful, original, and
out of the way, his fancy always assumes a foolish, unnatural vein, for the
reason that it is compounded of trite, hackneyed forms. In short, the natural
Frenchman is a conglomeration of commonplace, petty, everyday positiveness,
so that he is the most tedious person in the world.--Indeed, I believe that none
but greenhorns and excessively Russian people feel an attraction towards the
45
French; for, to any man of sensibility, such a compendium of outworn forms--a
compendium which is built up of drawing-room manners, expansiveness, and
gaiety--becomes at once over-noticeable and unbearable.
“I have come to see you on business,” De Griers began in a very off-hand, yet
polite, tone; “nor will I seek to conceal from you the fact that I have come in
the capacity of an emissary, of an intermediary, from the General. Having small
knowledge of the Russian tongue, I lost most of what was said last night; but,
the General has now explained matters, and I must confess that--“
”See here, Monsieur de Griers,” I interrupted. “I understand that you have
undertaken to act in this affair as an intermediary. Of course I am only ‘un
utchitel,’ a tutor, and have never claimed to be an intimate of this household,
nor to stand on at all familiar terms with it. Consequently, I do not know the
whole of its circumstances. Yet pray explain to me this: have you yourself
become one of its members, seeing that you are beginning to take such a part
in everything, and are now present as an intermediary?”
The Frenchman seemed not over-pleased at my question. It was one which was
too outspoken for his taste--and he had no mind to be frank with me.
“I am connected with the General,” he said drily, “partly through business
affairs, and partly through special circumstances. My principal has sent me
merely to ask you to forego your intentions of last evening. What you
contemplate is, I have no doubt, very clever; yet he has charged me to
represent to you that you have not the slightest chance of succeeding in your
end, since not only will the Baron refuse to receive you, but also he (the Baron)
has at his disposal every possible means for obviating further unpleasantness
from you. Surely you can see that yourself? What, then, would be the good of
going on with it all? On the other hand, the General promises that at the first
favourable opportunity he will receive you back into his household, and, in the
meantime, will credit you with your salary--with ‘vos appointements.’ Surely
that will suit you, will it not?”
Very quietly I replied that he (the Frenchman) was labouring under a delusion;
that perhaps, after all, I should not be expelled from the Baron’s presence, but,
46
on the contrary, be listened to; finally, that I should be glad if Monsieur de
Griers would confess that he was now visiting me merely in order to see how
far I intended to go in the affair.
“Good heavens!” cried de Griers. “Seeing that the General takes such an
interest in the matter, is there anything very unnatural in his desiring also to
know your plans? “
Again I began my explanations, but the Frenchman only fidgeted and rolled his
head about as he listened with an expression of manifest and unconcealed
irony on his face. In short, he adopted a supercilious attitude. For my own part,
I endeavoured to pretend that I took the affair very seriously. I declared that,
since the Baron had gone and complained of me to the General, as though I
were a mere servant of the General’s, he had, in the first place, lost me my
post, and, in the second place, treated me like a person to whom, as to one not
qualified to answer for himself, it was not even worth while to speak. Naturally,
I said, I felt insulted at this. Yet, comprehending as I did, differences of years,
of social status, and so forth (here I could scarcely help smiling), I was not
anxious to bring about further scenes by going personally to demand or to
request satisfaction of the Baron. All that I felt was that I had a right to go in
person and beg the Baron’s and the Baroness’s pardon--the more so since, of
late, I had been feeling unwell and unstrung, and had been in a fanciful
condition. And so forth, and so forth. Yet (I continued) the Baron’s offensive
behaviour to me of yesterday (that is to say, the fact of his referring the matter
to the General) as well as his insistence that the General should deprive me of
my post, had placed me in such a position that I could not well express my
regret to him (the Baron) and to his good lady, for the reason that in all
probability both he and the Baroness, with the world at large, would imagine
that I was doing so merely because I hoped, by my action, to recover my post.
Hence, I found myself forced to request the Baron to express to me HIS OWN
regrets, as well as to express them in the most unqualified manner--to say, in
fact, that he had never had any wish to insult me. After the Baron had done
THAT, I should, for my part, at once feel free to express to him,
whole-heartedly and without reserve, my own regrets.” In short,” I declared in
conclusion, “ my one desire is that the Baron may make it possible for me to
47
adopt the latter course.”
“Oh fie! What refinements and subtleties!” exclaimed De Griers. “Besides, what
have you to express regret for? Confess, Monsieur, Monsieur--pardon me, but I
have forgotten your name--confess, I say, that all this is merely a plan to
annoy the General? Or perhaps, you have some other and special end in view?
Eh?”
“In return you must pardon ME, mon cher Marquis, and tell me what you have
to do with it.”
“The General--“
”But what of the General? Last night he said that, for some reason or another,
it behoved him to ‘move with especial care at present;’ wherefore, he was
feeling nervous. But I did not understand the reference.”
“Yes, there DO exist special reasons for his doing so,” assented De Griers in a
conciliatory tone, yet with rising anger. “You are acquainted with Mlle. de
Cominges, are you not?”
“Mlle. Blanche, you mean?”
“Yes, Mlle. Blanche de Cominges. Doubtless you know also that the General is
in love with this young lady, and may even be about to marry her before he
leaves here? Imagine, therefore, what any scene or scandal would entail upon
him!”
“I cannot see that the marriage scheme need, be affected by scenes or
scandals.”
“Mais le Baron est si irascible--un caractere prussien, vous savez! Enfin il fera
une querelle d’Allemand.”
“I do not care,” I replied, “seeing that I no longer belong to his household” (of
set purpose I was trying to talk as senselessly as possible). “But is it quite
settled that Mlle. is to marry the General? What are they waiting for? Why
should they conceal such a matter--at all events from ourselves, the General’s
own party?”
48
“I cannot tell you. The marriage is not yet a settled affair, for they are awaiting
news from Russia. The General has business transactions to arrange.”
“Ah! Connected, doubtless, with madame his mother?”
De Griers shot at me a glance of hatred.
“To cut things short,” he interrupted, “I have complete confidence in your
native politeness, as well as in your tact and good sense. I feel sure that you
will do what I suggest, even if it is only for the sake of this family which has
received you as a kinsman into its bosom and has always loved and respected
you.”
“Be so good as to observe,” I remarked, “that the same family has just
EXPELLED me from its bosom. All that you are saying you are saying but for
show; but, when people have just said to you, ‘Of course we do not wish to
turn you out, yet, for the sake of appearance’s, you must PERMIT yourself to
be turned out,’ nothing can matter very much.”
“Very well, then,” he said, in a sterner and more arrogant tone. “Seeing that
my solicitations have had no effect upon you, it is my duty to mention that
other measures will be taken. There exist here police, you must remember, and
this very day they shall send you packing. Que diable! To think of a blanc bec
like yourself challenging a person like the Baron to a duel! Do you suppose that
you will be ALLOWED to do such things? Just try doing them, and see if any
one will be afraid of you! The reason why I have asked you to desist is that I
can see that your conduct is causing the General annoyance. Do you believe
that the Baron could not tell his lacquey simply to put you out of doors?”
“Nevertheless I should not GO out of doors,” I retorted with absolute calm.
“You are labouring under a delusion, Monsieur de Griers. The thing will be done
in far better trim than you imagine. I was just about to start for Mr. Astley’s, to
ask him to be my intermediary--in other words, my second. He has a strong
liking for me, and I do not think that he will refuse. He will go and see the
Baron on MY behalf, and the Baron will certainly not decline to receive him.
Although I am only a tutor--a kind of subaltern, Mr. Astley is known to all men
as the nephew of a real English lord, the Lord Piebroch, as well as a lord in his
49
own right. Yes, you may be pretty sure that the Baron will be civil to Mr. Astley,
and listen to him. Or, should he decline to do so, Mr. Astley will take the refusal
as a personal affront to himself (for you know how persistent the English are?)
and thereupon introduce to the Baron a friend of his own (and he has many
friends in a good position). That being so, picture to yourself the issue of the
affair--an affair which will not quite end as you think it will.”
This caused the Frenchman to bethink him of playing the coward. “Really things
may be as this fellow says,” he evidently thought. “Really he MIGHT be able to
engineer another scene.”
“Once more I beg of you to let the matter drop,” he continued in a tone that
was now entirely conciliatory. “One would think that it actually PLEASED you to
have scenes! Indeed, it is a brawl rather than genuine satisfaction that you are
seeking. I have said that the affair may prove to be diverting, and even clever,
and that possibly you may attain something by it; yet none the less I tell you”
(he said this only because he saw me rise and reach for my hat) “that I have
come hither also to hand you these few words from a certain person. Read
them, please, for I must take her back an answer.”
So saying, he took from his pocket a small, compact, wafer-sealed note, and
handed it to me. In Polina’s handwriting I read:
“I hear that you are thinking of going on with this affair. You have lost your
temper now, and are beginning to play the fool! Certain circumstances,
however, I may explain to you later. Pray cease from your folly, and put a
check upon yourself. For folly it all is. I have need of you, and, moreover, you
have promised to obey me. Remember the Shlangenberg. I ask you to be
obedient. If necessary, I shall even BID you be obedient.--Your own POLINA.
“P.S.--If so be that you still bear a grudge against me for what happened last
night, pray forgive me.”
Everything, to my eyes, seemed to change as I read these words. My lips grew
pale, and I began to tremble. Meanwhile, the cursed Frenchman was eyeing me
discreetly and askance, as though he wished to avoid witnessing my confusion.
It would have been better if he had laughed outright.
50
“Very well,” I said, “you can tell Mlle. not to disturb herself. But,” I added
sharply, “I would also ask you why you have been so long in handing me this
note? Instead of chattering about trifles, you ought to have delivered me the
missive at once--if you have really come commissioned as you say.”
“Well, pardon some natural haste on my part, for the situation is so strange. I
wished first to gain some personal knowledge of your intentions; and,
moreover, I did not know the contents of the note, and thought that it could be
given you at any time.”
“I understand,” I replied. “So you were ordered to hand me the note only in the
last resort, and if you could not otherwise appease me? Is it not so? Speak out,
Monsieur de Griers.”
“Perhaps,” said he, assuming a look of great forbearance, but gazing at me in a
meaning way.
I reached for my hat; whereupon he nodded, and went out. Yet on his lips I
fancied that I could see a mocking smile. How could it have been otherwise?
“You and I are to have a reckoning later, Master Frenchman,” I muttered as I
descended the stairs. “Yes, we will measure our strength together.” Yet my
thoughts were all in confusion, for again something seemed to have struck me
dizzy. Presently the air revived me a little, and, a couple of minutes later, my
brain had sufficiently cleared to enable two ideas in particular to stand out in it.
Firstly, I asked myself, which of the absurd, boyish, and extravagant threats
which I had uttered at random last night had made everybody so alarmed?
Secondly, what was the influence which this Frenchman appeared to exercise
over Polina? He had but to give the word, and at once she did as he desired--at
once she wrote me a note to beg of me to forbear! Of course, the relations
between the pair had, from the first, been a riddle to me--they had been so
ever since I had first made their acquaintance. But of late I had remarked in
her a strong aversion for, even a contempt for--him, while, for his part, he had
scarcely even looked at her, but had behaved towards her always in the most
churlish fashion. Yes, I had noted that. Also, Polina herself had mentioned to
me her dislike for him, and delivered herself of some remarkable confessions
51
on the subject. Hence, he must have got her into his power
somehow--somehow he must be holding her as in a vice.
VIII
All at once, on the Promenade, as it was called--that is to say, in the Chestnut
Avenue--I came face to face with my Englishman.
“I was just coming to see you,” he said; “and you appear to be out on a similar
errand. So you have parted with your employers?”
“How do you know that?” I asked in astonishment. “Is EVERY ONE aware of the
fact? “
”By no means. Not every one would consider such a fact to be of moment.
Indeed, I have never heard any one speak of it.”
“Then how come you to know it?”
“Because I have had occasion to do so. Whither are you bound? I like you, and
was therefore coming to pay you a visit.”
“What a splendid fellow you are, Mr. Astley!” I cried, though still wondering
how he had come by his knowledge. “And since I have not yet had my coffee,
and you have, in all probability, scarcely tasted yours, let us adjourn to the
Casino Cafe, where we can sit and smoke and have a talk.”
The cafe in question was only a hundred paces away; so, when coffee had been
brought, we seated ourselves, and I lit a cigarette. Astley was no smoker, but,
taking a seat by my side, he prepared himself to listen.
“I do not intend to go away,” was my first remark. “I intend, on the contrary,
to remain here.”
“That I never doubted,” he answered good-humouredly.
It is a curious fact that, on my way to see him, I had never even thought of
telling him of my love for Polina. In fact, I had purposely meant to avoid any
mention of the subject. Nor, during our stay in the place, had I ever made
52
aught but the scantiest reference to it. You see, not only was Astley a man of
great reserve, but also from the first I had perceived that Polina had made a
great impression upon him, although he never spoke of her. But now, strangely
enough, he had no sooner seated himself and bent his steely gaze upon me,
than, for some reason or another, I felt moved to tell him everything--to speak
to him of my love in all its phases. For an hour and a half did I discourse on the
subject, and found it a pleasure to do so, even though this was the first
occasion on which I had referred to the matter. Indeed, when, at certain
moments, I perceived that my more ardent passages confused him, I purposely
increased my ardour of narration. Yet one thing I regret: and that is that I
made references to the Frenchman which were a little over-personal.
Mr. Astley sat without moving as he listened to me. Not a word nor a sound of
any kind did he utter as he stared into my eyes. Suddenly, however, on my
mentioning the Frenchman, he interrupted me, and inquired sternly whether I
did right to speak of an extraneous matter (he had always been a strange man
in his mode of propounding questions).
“No, I fear not,” I replied.
“And concerning this Marquis and Mlle. Polina you know nothing beyond
surmise?”
Again I was surprised that such a categorical question should come from such a
reserved individual.
“No, I know nothing FOR CERTAIN about them” was my reply. “No--nothing.”
“Then you have done very wrong to speak of them to me, or even to imagine
things about them.”
“Quite so, quite so,” I interrupted in some astonishment. “I admit that. Yet that
is not the question.” Whereupon I related to him in detail the incident of two
days ago. I spoke of Polina’s outburst, of my encounter with the Baron, of my
dismissal, of the General’s extraordinary pusillanimity, and of the call which De
Griers had that morning paid me. In conclusion, I showed Astley the note which
I had lately received.
53
“What do you make of it?” I asked. “When I met you I was just coming to ask
you your opinion. For myself, I could have killed this Frenchman, and am not
sure that I shall not do so even yet.”
“I feel the same about it,” said Mr. Astley. “As for Mlle. Polina--well, you
yourself know that, if necessity drives, one enters into relation with people
whom one simply detests. Even between this couple there may be something
which, though unknown to you, depends upon extraneous circumstances. For,
my own part, I think that you may reassure yourself--or at all events partially.
And as for Mlle. Polina’s proceedings of two days ago, they were, of course,
strange; not because she can have meant to get rid of you, or to earn for you a
thrashing from the Baron’s cudgel (which for some curious reason, he did not
use, although he had it ready in his hands), but because such proceedings on
the part of such--well, of such a refined lady as Mlle. Polina are, to say the least
of it, unbecoming. But she cannot have guessed that you would carry out her
absurd wish to the letter?”
“Do you know what?” suddenly I cried as I fixed Mr. Astley with my gaze. “I
believe that you have already heard the story from some one--very possibly
from Mlle. Polina herself?”
In return he gave me an astonished stare.
“Your eyes look very fiery,” he said with a return of his former calm, “and in
them I can read suspicion. Now, you have no right whatever to be suspicious.
It is not a right which I can for a moment recognise, and I absolutely refuse to
answer your questions.”
“Enough! You need say no more,” I cried with a strange emotion at my heart,
yet not altogether understanding what had aroused that emotion in my breast.
Indeed, when, where, and how could Polina have chosen Astley to be one of
her confidants? Of late I had come rather to overlook him in this connection,
even though Polina had always been a riddle to me--so much so that now,
when I had just permitted myself to tell my friend of my infatuation in all its
aspects, I had found myself struck, during the very telling, with the fact that in
my relations with her I could specify nothing that was explicit, nothing that was
54
positive. On the contrary, my relations had been purely fantastic, strange, and
unreal; they had been unlike anything else that I could think of.
“Very well, very well,” I replied with a warmth equal to Astley’s own. “Then I
stand confounded, and have no further opinions to offer. But you are a good
fellow, and I am glad to know what you think about it all, even though I do not
need your advice.”
Then, after a pause, I resumed:
“For instance, what reason should you assign for the General taking fright in
this way? Why should my stupid clowning have led the world to elevate it into a
serious incident? Even De Griers has found it necessary to put in his oar (and
he only interferes on the most important occasions), and to visit me, and to
address to me the most earnest supplications. Yes, HE, De Griers, has actually
been playing the suppliant to ME! And, mark you, although he came to me as
early as nine o’clock, he had ready-prepared in his hand Mlle. Polina’s note.
When, I would ask, was that note written? Mlle. Polina must have been aroused
from sleep for the express purpose of writing it. At all events the circumstance
shows that she is an absolute slave to the Frenchman, since she actually begs
my pardon in the note--actually begs my pardon! Yet what is her personal
concern in the matter? Why is she interested in it at all? Why, too, is the whole
party so afraid of this precious Baron? And what sort of a business do you call it
for the General to be going to marry Mlle. Blanche de Cominges? He told me
last night that, because of the circumstance, he must ‘move with especial care
at present.’ What is your opinion of it all? Your look convinces me that you
know more about it than I do.”
Mr. Astley smiled and nodded.
“Yes, I think I DO know more about it than you do,” he assented. “The affair
centres around this Mlle. Blanche. Of that I feel certain.”
“And what of Mlle. Blanche?” I cried impatiently (for in me there had dawned a
sudden hope that this would enable me to discover something about Polina).
“Well, my belief is that at the present moment Mlle. Blanche has, in very truth,
55
a special reason for wishing to avoid any trouble with the Baron and the
Baroness. It might lead not only to some unpleasantness, but even to a
scandal.”
“Oh, oh! “
”Also I may tell you that Mlle. Blanche has been in Roulettenberg before, for
she was staying here three seasons ago. I myself was in the place at the time,
and in those days Mlle. Blanche was not known as Mlle. de Cominges, nor was
her mother, the Widow de Cominges, even in existence. In any case no one
ever mentioned the latter. De Griers, too, had not materialised, and I am
convinced that not only do the parties stand in no relation to one another, but
also they have not long enjoyed one another’s acquaintance. Likewise, the
Marquisate de Griers is of recent creation. Of that I have reason to be sure,
owing to a certain circumstance. Even the name De Griers itself may be taken
to be a new invention, seeing that I have a friend who once met the said
‘Marquis’ under a different name altogether.”
“Yet he possesses a good circle of friends?”
“Possibly. Mlle. Blanche also may possess that. Yet it is not three years since
she received from the local police, at the instance of the Baroness, an invitation
to leave the town. And she left it.”
“But why?”
“Well, I must tell you that she first appeared here in company with an Italian--a
prince of some sort, a man who bore an historic name (Barberini or something
of the kind). The fellow was simply a mass of rings and diamonds -- real
diamonds, too -- and the couple used to drive out in a marvellous carriage. At
first Mlle. Blanche played ‘trente et quarante’ with fair success, but, later, her
luck took a marked change for the worse. I distinctly remember that in a single
evening she lost an enormous sum. But worse was to ensue, for one fine
morning her prince disappeared--horses, carriage, and all. Also, the hotel bill
which he left unpaid was enormous. Upon this Mlle. Zelma (the name which she
assumed after figuring as Madame Barberini) was in despair. She shrieked and
howled all over the hotel, and even tore her clothes in her frenzy. In the hotel
56
there was staying also a Polish count (you must know that ALL travelling Poles
are counts!), and the spectacle of Mlle. Zelma tearing her clothes and, catlike,
scratching her face with her beautiful, scented nails produced upon him a
strong impression. So the pair had a talk together, and, by luncheon time, she
was consoled. Indeed, that evening the couple entered the Casino arm-in-arm
-- Mlle. Zelma laughing loudly, according to her custom, and showing even
more expansiveness in her manners than she had before shown. For instance,
she thrust her way into the file of women roulette-players in the exact fashion
of those ladies who, to clear a space for themselves at the tables, push their
fellow-players roughly aside. Doubtless you have noticed them?”
“Yes, certainly.”
“Well, they are not worth noticing. To the annoyance of the decent public they
are allowed to remain here--at all events such of them as daily change 4000
franc notes at the tables (though, as soon as ever these women cease to do so,
they receive an invitation to depart). However, Mlle. Zelma continued to change
notes of this kind, but her play grew more and more unsuccessful, despite the
fact that such ladies’ luck is frequently good, for they have a surprising amount
of cash at their disposal. Suddenly, the Count too disappeared, even as the
Prince had done, and that same evening Mlle. Zelma was forced to appear in
the Casino alone. On this occasion no one offered her a greeting. Two days
later she had come to the end of her resources; whereupon, after staking and
losing her last louis d’or she chanced to look around her, and saw standing by
her side the Baron Burmergelm, who had been eyeing her with fixed
disapproval. To his distaste, however, Mlle. paid no attention, but, turning to
him with her well-known smile, requested him to stake, on her behalf, ten louis
on the red. Later that evening a complaint from the Baroness led the
authorities to request Mlle. not to re-enter the Casino. If you feel in any way
surprised that I should know these petty and unedifying details, the reason is
that I had them from a relative of mine who, later that evening, drove Mlle.
Zelma in his carriage from Roulettenberg to Spa. Now, mark you, Mlle. wants
to become Madame General, in order that, in future, she may be spared the
receipt of such invitations from Casino authorities as she received three years
ago. At present she is not playing; but that is only because, according to the
57
signs, she is lending money to other players. Yes, that is a much more paying
game. I even suspect that the unfortunate General is himself in her debt, as
well as, perhaps, also De Griers. Or, it may be that the latter has entered into a
partnership with her. Consequently you yourself will see that, until the
marriage shall have been consummated, Mlle. would scarcely like to have the
attention of the Baron and the Baroness drawn to herself. In short, to any one
in her position, a scandal would be most detrimental. You form a member of
the menage of these people; wherefore, any act of yours might cause such a
scandal--and the more so since daily she appears in public arm in arm with the
General or with Mlle. Polina. NOW do you understand?”
“No, I do not!” I shouted as I banged my fist down upon the table--banged it
with such violence that a frightened waiter came running towards us. “Tell me,
Mr. Astley, why, if you knew this history all along, and, consequently, always
knew who this Mlle. Blanche is, you never warned either myself or the General,
nor, most of all, Mlle. Polina” (who is accustomed to appear in the Casino -- in
public everywhere with Mlle. Blanche).” How could you do it?”
“It would have done no good to warn you,” he replied quietly, “for the reason
that you could have effected nothing. Against what was I to warn you? As likely
as not, the General knows more about Mlle. Blanche even than I do; yet the
unhappy man still walks about with her and Mlle. Polina. Only yesterday I saw
this Frenchwoman riding, splendidly mounted, with De Griers, while the General
was careering in their wake on a roan horse. He had said, that morning, that
his legs were hurting him, yet his riding-seat was easy enough. As he passed I
looked at him, and the thought occurred to me that he was a man lost for ever.
However, it is no affair of mine, for I have only recently had the happiness to
make Mlle. Polina’s acquaintance. Also”--he added this as an afterthought--“I
have already told you that I do not recognise your right to ask me certain
questions, however sincere be my liking for you.”
“Enough,” I said, rising. “To me it is as clear as day that Mlle. Polina knows all
about this Mlle. Blanche, but cannot bring herself to part with her Frenchman;
wherefore, she consents also to be seen in public with Mlle. Blanche. You may
be sure that nothing else would ever have induced her either to walk about
58
with this Frenchwoman or to send me a note not to touch the Baron. Yes, it is
THERE that the influence lies before which everything in the world must bow!
Yet she herself it was who launched me at the Baron! The devil take it, but I
was left no choice in the matter.”
“You forget, in the first place, that this Mlle. de Cominges is the General’s
inamorata, and, in the second place, that Mlle. Polina, the General’s
step-daughter, has a younger brother and sister who, though they are the
General’s own children, are completely neglected by this madman, and robbed
as well.”
“Yes, yes; that is so. For me to go and desert the children now would mean
their total abandonment; whereas, if I remain, I should be able to defend their
interests, and, perhaps, to save a moiety of their property. Yes, yes; that is
quite true. And yet, and yet--Oh, I can well understand why they are all so
interested in the General’s mother!”
“In whom? “ asked Mr. Astley.
“In the old woman of Moscow who declines to die, yet concerning whom they
are for ever expecting telegrams to notify the fact of her death.”
“Ah, then of course their interests centre around her. It is a question of
succession. Let that but be settled, and the General will marry, Mlle. Polina will
be set free, and De Griers--“
”Yes, and De Griers?”
“Will be repaid his money, which is what he is now waiting for.”
“What? You think that he is waiting for that?”
“I know of nothing else,” asserted Mr. Astley doggedly.
“But, I do, I do!” I shouted in my fury. “He is waiting also for the old woman’s
will, for the reason that it awards Mlle. Polina a dowry. As soon as ever the
money is received, she will throw herself upon the Frenchman’s neck. All
women are like that. Even the proudest of them become abject slaves where
marriage is concerned. What Polina is good for is to fall head over ears in love.
59
That is MY opinion. Look at her--especially when she is sitting alone, and
plunged in thought. All this was pre-ordained and foretold, and is accursed.
Polina could perpetrate any mad act. She--she--But who called me by name?” I
broke off. “Who is shouting for me? I heard some one calling in Russian, ‘Alexis
Ivanovitch!’ It was a woman’s voice. Listen!”
At the moment, we were approaching my hotel. We had left the cafe long ago,
without even noticing that we had done so.
“Yes, I DID hear a woman’s voice calling, but whose I do not know. The
someone was calling you in Russian. Ah! NOW I can see whence the cries
come. They come from that lady there--the one who is sitting on the settee,
the one who has just been escorted to the verandah by a crowd of lacqueys.
Behind her see that pile of luggage! She must have arrived by train.”
“But why should she be calling ME? Hear her calling again! See! She is
beckoning to us!”
“Yes, so she is,” assented Mr. Astley.
“Alexis Ivanovitch, Alexis Ivanovitch! Good heavens, what a stupid fellow!”
came in a despairing wail from the verandah.
We had almost reached the portico, and I was just setting foot upon the space
before it, when my hands fell to my sides in limp astonishment, and my feet
glued themselves to the pavement!
IX
For on the topmost tier of the hotel verandah, after being carried up the steps
in an armchair amid a bevy of footmen, maid-servants, and other menials of
the hotel, headed by the landlord (that functionary had actually run out to meet
a visitor who arrived with so much stir and din, attended by her own retinue,
and accompanied by so great a pile of trunks and portmanteaux)--on the
topmost tier of the verandah, I say, there was sitting--THE GRANDMOTHER!
Yes, it was she--rich, and imposing, and seventy-five years of age--Antonida
Vassilievna Tarassevitcha, landowner and grande dame of Moscow--the “La
60
Baboulenka” who had caused so many telegrams to be sent off and
received--who had been dying, yet not dying--who had, in her own person,
descended upon us even as snow might fall from the clouds! Though unable to
walk, she had arrived borne aloft in an armchair (her mode of conveyance for
the last five years), as brisk, aggressive, self-satisfied, bolt-upright, loudly
imperious, and generally abusive as ever. In fact, she looked exactly as she
had on the only two occasions when I had seen her since my appointment to
the General’s household. Naturally enough, I stood petrified with astonishment.
She had sighted me a hundred paces off! Even while she was being carried
along in her chair she had recognised me, and called me by name and surname
(which, as usual, after hearing once, she had remembered ever afterwards).
“And this is the woman whom they had thought to see in her grave after
making her will!” I thought to myself. “Yet she will outlive us, and every one
else in the hotel. Good Lord! what is going to become of us now? What on earth
is to happen to the General? She will turn the place upside down!”
“My good sir,” the old woman continued in a stentorian voice, “what are you
standing THERE for, with your eyes almost falling out of your head? Cannot you
come and say how-do-you-do? Are you too proud to shake hands? Or do you
not recognise me? Here, Potapitch!” she cried to an old servant who, dressed in
a frock coat and white waistcoat, had a bald, red head (he was the chamberlain
who always accompanied her on her journeys). “Just think! Alexis Ivanovitch
does not recognise me! They have buried me for good and all! Yes, and after
sending hosts of telegrams to know if I were dead or not! Yes, yes, I have
heard the whole story. I am very much alive, though, as you may see.”
“Pardon me, Antonida Vassilievna,” I replied good humouredly as I recovered
my presence of mind. “I have no reason to wish you ill. I am merely rather
astonished to see you. Why should I not be so, seeing how unexpected--“
”WHY should you be astonished? I just got into my chair, and came. Things are
quiet enough in the train, for there is no one there to chatter. Have you been
out for a walk?”
“Yes. I have just been to the Casino.”
61
“Oh? Well, it is quite nice here,” she went on as she looked about her. “The
place seems comfortable, and all the trees are out. I like it very well. Are your
people at home? Is the General, for instance, indoors?”
“Yes; and probably all of them.”
“Do they observe the convenances, and keep up appearances? Such things
always give one tone. I have heard that they are keeping a carriage, even as
Russian gentlefolks ought to do. When abroad, our Russian people always cut a
dash. Is Prascovia here too ?”
“Yes. Polina Alexandrovna is here.”
“And the Frenchwoman? However, I will go and look for them myself. Tell me
the nearest way to their rooms. Do you like being here?”
“Yes, I thank you, Antonida Vassilievna.”
“And you, Potapitch, you go and tell that fool of a landlord to reserve me a
suitable suite of rooms. They must be handsomely decorated, and not too high
up. Have my luggage taken up to them. But what are you tumbling over
yourselves for? Why are you all tearing about? What scullions these fellows
are!--Who is that with you?” she added to myself.
“A Mr. Astley,” I replied.
“And who is Mr. Astley?”
“A fellow-traveller, and my very good friend, as well as an acquaintance of the
General’s.”
“Oh, an Englishman? Then that is why he stared at me without even opening
his lips. However, I like Englishmen. Now, take me upstairs, direct to their
rooms. Where are they lodging?”
Madame was lifted up in her chair by the lacqueys, and I preceded her up the
grand staircase. Our progress was exceedingly effective, for everyone whom we
met stopped to stare at the cortege. It happened that the hotel had the
reputation of being the best, the most expensive, and the most aristocratic in
62
all the spa, and at every turn on the staircase or in the corridors we
encountered fine ladies and important-looking Englishmen--more than one of
whom hastened downstairs to inquire of the awestruck landlord who the
newcomer was. To all such questions he returned the same answer--namely,
that the old lady was an influential foreigner, a Russian, a Countess, and a
grande dame, and that she had taken the suite which, during the previous
week, had been tenanted by the Grande Duchesse de N.
Meanwhile the cause of the sensation--the Grandmother--was being borne aloft
in her armchair. Every person whom she met she scanned with an inquisitive
eye, after first of all interrogating me about him or her at the top of her voice.
She was stout of figure, and, though she could not leave her chair, one felt, the
moment that one first looked at her, that she was also tall of stature. Her back
was as straight as a board, and never did she lean back in her seat. Also, her
large grey head, with its keen, rugged features, remained always erect as she
glanced about her in an imperious, challenging sort of way, with looks and
gestures that clearly were unstudied. Though she had reached her
seventy-sixth year, her face was still fresh, and her teeth had not decayed.
Lastly, she was dressed in a black silk gown and white mobcap.
“She interests me tremendously,” whispered Mr. Astley as, still smoking, he
walked by my side. Meanwhile I was reflecting that probably the old lady knew
all about the telegrams, and even about De Griers, though little or nothing
about Mlle. Blanche. I said as much to Mr. Astley.
But what a frail creature is man! No sooner was my first surprise abated than I
found myself rejoicing in the shock which we were about to administer to the
General. So much did the thought inspire me that I marched ahead in the
gayest of fashions.
Our party was lodging on the third floor. Without knocking at the door, or in
any way announcing our presence, I threw open the portals, and the
Grandmother was borne through them in triumph. As though of set purpose,
the whole party chanced at that moment to be assembled in the General’s
study. The time was eleven o’clock, and it seemed that an outing of some sort
(at which a portion of the party were to drive in carriages, and others to ride on
63
horseback, accompanied by one or two extraneous acquaintances) was being
planned. The General was present, and also Polina, the children, the latter’s
nurses, De Griers, Mlle. Blanche (attired in a riding-habit), her mother, the
young Prince, and a learned German whom I beheld for the first time. Into the
midst of this assembly the lacqueys conveyed Madame in her chair, and set her
down within three paces of the General!
Good heavens! Never shall I forget the spectacle which ensued! Just before our
entry, the General had been holding forth to the company, with De Griers in
support of him. I may also mention that, for the last two or three days, Mlle.
Blanche and De Griers had been making a great deal of the young Prince, under
the very nose of the poor General. In short, the company, though decorous and
conventional, was in a gay, familiar mood. But no sooner did the Grandmother
appear than the General stopped dead in the middle of a word, and, with jaw
dropping, stared hard at the old lady--his eyes almost starting out of his head,
and his expression as spellbound as though he had just seen a basilisk. In
return, the Grandmother stared at him silently and without moving--though
with a look of mingled challenge, triumph, and ridicule in her eyes. For ten
seconds did the pair remain thus eyeing one another, amid the profound silence
of the company; and even De Griers sat petrified--an extraordinary look of
uneasiness dawning on his face. As for Mlle. Blanche, she too stared wildly at
the Grandmother, with eyebrows raised and her lips parted--while the Prince
and the German savant contemplated the tableau in profound amazement.
Only Polina looked anything but perplexed or surprised. Presently, however,
she too turned as white as a sheet, and then reddened to her temples. Truly
the Grandmother’s arrival seemed to be a catastrophe for everybody! For my
own part, I stood looking from the Grandmother to the company, and back
again, while Mr. Astley, as usual, remained in the background, and gazed
calmly and decorously at the scene.
“Well, here I am--and instead of a telegram, too!” the Grandmother at last
ejaculated, to dissipate the silence. “What? You were not expecting me?”
“Antonida Vassilievna! O my dearest mother! But how on earth did you, did
you--?” The mutterings of the unhappy General died away.
64
I verily believe that if the Grandmother had held her tongue a few seconds
longer she would have had a stroke.
“How on earth did I WHAT?” she exclaimed. “Why, I just got into the train and
came here. What else is the railway meant for? But you thought that I had
turned up my toes and left my property to the lot of you. Oh, I know ALL about
the telegrams which you have been dispatching. They must have cost you a
pretty sum, I should think, for telegrams are not sent from abroad for nothing.
Well, I picked up my heels, and came here. Who is this Frenchman? Monsieur
de Griers, I suppose?”
“Oui, madame,” assented De Griers. “Et, croyez, je suis si enchante! Votre
sante--c’est un miracle vous voir ici. Une surprise charmante!”
“Just so. ‘Charmante!’ I happen to know you as a mountebank, and therefore
trust you no more than THIS.” She indicated her little finger. “And who is
THAT?” she went on, turning towards Mlle. Blanche. Evidently the
Frenchwoman looked so becoming in her riding-habit, with her whip in her
hand, that she had made an impression upon the old lady. “Who is that woman
there?”
“Mlle. de Cominges,” I said. “And this is her mother, Madame de Cominges.
They also are staying in the hotel.”
“Is the daughter married?” asked the old lady, without the least semblance of
ceremony.
“No,” I replied as respectfully as possible, but under my breath.
“Is she good company?”
I failed to understand the question.
“I mean, is she or is she not a bore? Can she speak Russian? When this De
Griers was in Moscow he soon learnt to make himself understood.”
I explained to the old lady that Mlle. Blanche had never visited Russia.
“Bonjour, then,” said Madame, with sudden brusquerie.
65
“Bonjour, madame,” replied Mlle. Blanche with an elegant, ceremonious bow
as, under cover of an unwonted modesty, she endeavoured to express, both in
face and figure, her extreme surprise at such strange behaviour on the part of
the Grandmother.
“How the woman sticks out her eyes at me! How she mows and minces!” was
the Grandmother’s comment. Then she turned suddenly to the General, and
continued: “I have taken up my abode here, so am going to be your next-door
neighbour. Are you glad to hear that, or are you not?”
“My dear mother, believe me when I say that I am. sincerely delighted,”
returned the General, who had now, to a certain extent, recovered his senses;
and inasmuch as, when occasion arose, he could speak with fluency, gravity,
and a certain effect, he set himself to be expansive in his remarks, and went
on: “We have been so dismayed and upset by the news of your indisposition!
We had received such hopeless telegrams about you! Then suddenly--“
”Fibs, fibs!” interrupted the Grandmother.
“How on earth, too, did you come to decide upon the journey?” continued the
General, with raised voice as he hurried to overlook the old lady’s last remark.
“Surely, at your age, and in your present state of health, the thing is so
unexpected that our surprise is at least intelligible. However, I am glad to see
you (as indeed, are we all”--he said this with a dignified, yet conciliatory,
smile), “and will use my best endeavours to render your stay here as pleasant
as possible.”
“Enough! All this is empty chatter. You are talking the usual nonsense. I shall
know quite well how to spend my time. How did I come to undertake the
journey, you ask? Well, is there anything so very surprising about it? It was
done quite simply. What is every one going into ecstasies about?--How do you
do, Prascovia? What are YOU doing here?”
“And how are YOU, Grandmother?” replied Polina, as she approached the old
lady. “Were you long on the journey?”.
“The most sensible question that I have yet been asked! Well, you shall hear
66
for yourself how it all happened. I lay and lay, and was doctored and doctored,;
until at last I drove the physicians from me, and called in an apothecary from
Nicolai who had cured an old woman of a malady similar to my own--cured her
merely with a little hayseed. Well, he did me a great deal of good, for on the
third day I broke into a sweat, and was able to leave my bed. Then my German
doctors held another consultation, put on their spectacles, and told me that if I
would go abroad, and take a course of the waters, the indisposition would
finally pass away. ‘Why should it not?’ I thought to myself. So I had got things
ready, and on the following day, a Friday, set out for here. I occupied a special
compartment in the train, and where ever I had to change I found at the
station bearers who were ready to carry me for a few coppers. You have nice
quarters here,” she went on as she glanced around the room. “ But where on
earth did you get the money for them, my good sir? I thought that everything
of yours had been mortgaged? This Frenchman alone must be your creditor for
a good deal. Oh, I know all about it, all about it.”
“I-I am surprised at you, my dearest mother,” said the General in some
confusion. “I-I am greatly surprised. But I do not need any extraneous control
of my finances. Moreover, my expenses do not exceed my income, and we--“
”They do not exceed it? Fie! Why, you are robbing your children of their last
kopeck--you, their guardian!”
“After this,” said the General, completely taken aback, “--after what you have
just said, I do not know whether--“
”You do not know what? By heavens, are you never going to drop that roulette
of yours? Are you going to whistle all your property away?”
This made such an impression upon the General that he almost choked with
fury.
“Roulette, indeed? I play roulette? Really, in view of my position--Recollect
what you are saying, my dearest mother. You must still be unwell.”
“Rubbish, rubbish!” she retorted. “The truth is that you CANNOT be got away
from that roulette. You are simply telling lies. This very day I mean to go and
67
see for myself what roulette is like. Prascovia, tell me what there is to be seen
here; and do you, Alexis Ivanovitch, show me everything; and do you,
Potapitch, make me a list of excursions. What IS there to be seen?” again she
inquired of Polina.
“There is a ruined castle, and the Shlangenberg.”
“The Shlangenberg? What is it? A forest?”
“No, a mountain on the summit of which there is a place fenced off. From it you
can get a most beautiful view.”
“Could a chair be carried up that mountain of yours?”
“Doubtless we could find bearers for the purpose,” I interposed.
At this moment Theodosia, the nursemaid, approached the old lady with the
General’s children.
“No, I DON’T want to see them,” said the Grandmother. “I hate kissing
children, for their noses are always wet. How are you getting on, Theodosia?”
“I am very well, thank you, Madame,” replied the nursemaid. “And how is your
ladyship? We have been feeling so anxious about you!”
“Yes, I know, you simple soul--But who are those other guests?” the old lady
continued, turning again to Polina. “For instance, who is that old rascal in the
spectacles?”
“Prince Nilski, Grandmamma,” whispered Polina.
“Oh, a Russian? Why, I had no idea that he could understand me! Surely he did
not hear what I said? As for Mr. Astley, I have seen him already, and I see that
he is here again. How do you do?” she added to the gentleman in question.
Mr. Astley bowed in silence
“Have you NOTHING to say to me?” the old lady went on. “Say something, for
goodness’ sake! Translate to him, Polina.”
Polina did so.
68
“I have only to say,” replied Mr. Astley gravely, but also with alacrity, “that I
am indeed glad to see you in such good health.” This was interpreted to the
Grandmother, and she seemed much gratified.
“How well English people know how to answer one!” she remarked. “That is
why I like them so much better than French. Come here,” she added to Mr.
Astley. “I will try not to bore you too much. Polina, translate to him that I am
staying in rooms on a lower floor. Yes, on a lower floor,” she repeated to
Astley, pointing downwards with her finger.
Astley looked pleased at receiving the invitation.
Next, the old lady scanned Polina, from head to foot with minute attention.
“I could almost have liked you, Prascovia,” suddenly she remarked, “for you are
a nice girl--the best of the lot. You have some character about you. I too have
character. Turn round. Surely that is not false hair that you are wearing?”
“No, Grandmamma. It is my own.”
“Well, well. I do not like the stupid fashions of today. You are very good
looking. I should have fallen in love with you if I had been a man. Why do you
not get married? It is time now that I was going. I want to walk, yet I always
have to ride. Are you still in a bad temper?” she added to the General.
“No, indeed,” rejoined the now mollified General.
“I quite understand that at your time of life--“
”Cette vieille est tombee en enfance,” De Griers whispered to me.
“But I want to look round a little,” the old lady added to the General. Will you
lend me Alexis Ivanovitch for the purpose?
“As much as you like. But I myself--yes, and Polina and Monsieur de Griers
too--we all of us hope to have the pleasure of escorting you.”
“Mais, madame, cela sera un plaisir,” De Griers commented with a bewitching
smile.
“‘Plaisir’ indeed! Why, I look upon you as a perfect fool, monsieur.” Then she
69
remarked to the General: “I am not going to let you have any of my money. I
must be off to my rooms now, to see what they are like. Afterwards we will
look round a little. Lift me up.”
Again the Grandmother was borne aloft and carried down the staircase amid a
perfect bevy of followers--the General walking as though he had been hit over
the head with a cudgel, and De Griers seeming to be plunged in thought.
Endeavouring to be left behind, Mlle. Blanche next thought better of it, and
followed the rest, with the Prince in her wake. Only the German savant and
Madame de Cominges did not leave the General’s apartments.
X
At spas--and, probably, all over Europe--hotel landlords and managers are
guided in their allotment of rooms to visitors, not so much by the wishes and
requirements of those visitors, as by their personal estimate of the same. It
may also be said that these landlords and managers seldom make a mistake.
To the Grandmother, however, our landlord, for some reason or another,
allotted such a sumptuous suite that he fairly overreached himself; for he
assigned her a suite consisting of four magnificently appointed rooms, with
bathroom, servants’ quarters, a separate room for her maid, and so on. In fact,
during the previous week the suite had been occupied by no less a personage
than a Grand Duchess: which circumstance was duly explained to the new
occupant, as an excuse for raising the price of these apartments. The
Grandmother had herself carried-- or, rather, wheeled--through each room in
turn, in order that she might subject the whole to a close and attentive
scrutiny; while the landlord--an elderly, bald-headed man--walked respectfully
by her side.
What every one took the Grandmother to be I do not know, but it appeared, at
least, that she was accounted a person not only of great importance, but also,
and still more, of great wealth; and without delay they entered her in the hotel
register as “Madame la Generale, Princesse de Tarassevitcheva,” although she
had never been a princess in her life. Her retinue, her reserved compartment in
the train, her pile of unnecessary trunks, portmanteaux, and strong-boxes, all
70
helped to increase her prestige; while her wheeled chair, her sharp tone and
voice, her eccentric questions (put with an air of the most overbearing and
unbridled imperiousness), her whole figure--upright, rugged, and commanding
as it was--completed the general awe in which she was held. As she inspected
her new abode she ordered her chair to be stopped at intervals in order that,
with finger extended towards some article of furniture, she might ply the
respectfully smiling, yet secretly apprehensive, landlord with unexpected
questions. She addressed them to him in French, although her pronunciation of
the language was so bad that sometimes I had to translate them. For the most
part, the landlord’s answers were unsatisfactory, and failed to please her; nor
were the questions themselves of a practical nature, but related, generally, to
God knows what.
For instance, on one occasion she halted before a picture which, a poor copy of
a well-known original, had a mythological subject.
“Of whom is this a portrait?” she inquired.
The landlord explained that it was probably that of a countess.
“But how know you that?” the old lady retorted.
“You live here, yet you cannot say for certain! And why is the picture there at
all? And why do its eyes look so crooked?”
To all these questions the landlord could return no satisfactory reply, despite
his floundering endeavours.
“The blockhead!” exclaimed the Grandmother in Russian.
Then she proceeded on her way--only to repeat the same story in front of a
Saxon statuette which she had sighted from afar, and had commanded, for
some reason or another, to be brought to her. Finally, she inquired of the
landlord what was the value of the carpet in her bedroom, as well as where the
said carpet had been manufactured; but, the landlord could do no more than
promise to make inquiries.
“What donkeys these people are!” she commented. Next, she turned her
71
attention to the bed.
“What a huge counterpane!” she exclaimed. “Turn it back, please.” The
lacqueys did so.
“Further yet, further yet,” the old lady cried. “Turn it RIGHT back. Also, take off
those pillows and bolsters, and lift up the feather bed.”
The bed was opened for her inspection.
“Mercifully it contains no bugs,” she remarked.
“Pull off the whole thing, and then put on my own pillows and sheets. The place
is too luxurious for an old woman like myself. It is too large for any one person.
Alexis Ivanovitch, come and see me whenever you are not teaching your
pupils,”
“After tomorrow I shall no longer be in the General’s service,” I replied, “but
merely living in the hotel on my own account.”
“Why so?”
“Because, the other day, there arrived from Berlin a German and his
wife--persons of some importance; and, it chanced that, when taking a walk, I
spoke to them in German without having properly compassed the Berlin
accent.”
“Indeed?”
“Yes: and this action on my part the Baron held to be an insult, and complained
about it to the General, who yesterday dismissed me from his employ.”
“But I suppose you must have threatened that precious Baron, or something of
the kind? However, even if you did so, it was a matter of no moment.”
“No, I did not. The Baron was the aggressor by raising his stick at me.”
Upon that the Grandmother turned sharply to the General.
“What? You permitted yourself to treat your tutor thus, you nincompoop, and
to dismiss him from his post? You are a blockhead--an utter blockhead! I can
72
see that clearly.”
“Do not alarm yourself, my dear mother,” the General replied with a lofty
air--an air in which there was also a tinge of familiarity. “I am quite capable of
managing my own affairs. Moreover, Alexis Ivanovitch has not given you a true
account of the matter.”
“What did you do next?” The old lady inquired of me.
“I wanted to challenge the Baron to a duel,” I replied as modestly as possible;
“but the General protested against my doing so.”
“And WHY did you so protest? “ she inquired of the General. Then she turned to
the landlord, and questioned him as to whether HE would not have fought a
duel, if challenged. “For,” she added, “I can see no difference between you and
the Baron; nor can I bear that German visage of yours.” Upon this the landlord
bowed and departed, though he could not have understood the Grandmother’s
compliment.
“Pardon me, Madame,” the General continued with a sneer, “but are duels
really feasible?”
“Why not? All men are crowing cocks, and that is why they quarrel. YOU,
though, I perceive, are a blockhead--a man who does not even know how to
carry his breeding. Lift me up. Potapitch, see to it that you always have TWO
bearers ready. Go and arrange for their hire. But we shall not require more
than two, for I shall need only to be carried upstairs. On the level or in the
street I can be WHEELED along. Go and tell them that, and pay them in
advance, so that they may show me some respect. You too, Potapitch, are
always to come with me, and YOU, Alexis Ivanovitch, are to point out to me
this Baron as we go along, in order that I may get a squint at the precious
‘Von.’ And where is that roulette played?”
I explained to her that the game was carried on in the salons of the Casino;
whereupon there ensued a string of questions as to whether there were many
such salons, whether many people played in them, whether those people
played a whole day at a time, and whether the game was managed according
73
to fixed rules. At length, I thought it best to say that the most advisable course
would be for her to go and see it for herself, since a mere description of it
would be a difficult matter.
“Then take me straight there,” she said, “and do you walk on in front of me,
Alexis Ivanovitch.”
“What, mother? Before you have so much as rested from your journey?” the
General inquired with some solicitude. Also, for some reason which I could not
divine, he seemed to be growing nervous; and, indeed, the whole party was
evincing signs of confusion, and exchanging glances with one another. Probably
they were thinking that it would be a ticklish--even an embarrassing--business
to accompany the Grandmother to the Casino, where, very likely, she would
perpetrate further eccentricities, and in public too! Yet on their own initiative
they had offered to escort her!
“Why should I rest?” she retorted. “I am not tired, for I have been sitting still
these past five days. Let us see what your medicinal springs and waters are
like, and where they are situated. What, too, about that, that--what did you
call it, Prascovia?--oh, about that mountain top?”
“Yes, we are going to see it, Grandmamma.”
“Very well. Is there anything else for me to see here?”
“Yes! Quite a number of things,” Polina forced herself to say.
“Martha, YOU must come with me as well,” went on the old lady to her maid.
“No, no, mother!” ejaculated the General. “Really she cannot come. They would
not admit even Potapitch to the Casino.”
“Rubbish! Because she is my servant, is that a reason for turning her out? Why,
she is only a human being like the rest of us; and as she has been travelling for
a week she might like to look about her. With whom else could she go out but
myself ? She would never dare to show her nose in the street alone.”
“But, mother--“
74
”Are you ashamed to be seen with me? Stop at home, then, and you will be
asked no questions. A pretty General YOU are, to be sure! I am a general’s
widow myself. But, after all, why should I drag the whole party with me? I will
go and see the sights with only Alexis Ivanovitch as my escort.”
De Griers strongly insisted that EVERY ONE ought to accompany her. Indeed,
he launched out into a perfect shower of charming phrases concerning the
pleasure of acting as her cicerone, and so forth. Every one was touched with his
words.
“Mais elle est tombee en enfance,” he added aside to the General. “ Seule, elle
fera des betises.” More than this I could not overhear, but he seemed to have
got some plan in his mind, or even to be feeling a slight return of his hopes.
The distance to the Casino was about half a verst, and our route led us through
the Chestnut Avenue until we reached the square directly fronting the building.
The General, I could see, was a trifle reassured by the fact that, though our
progress was distinctly eccentric in its nature, it was, at least, correct and
orderly. As a matter of fact, the spectacle of a person who is unable to walk is
not anything to excite surprise at a spa. Yet it was clear that the General had a
great fear of the Casino itself: for why should a person who had lost the use of
her limbs--more especially an old woman--be going to rooms which were set
apart only for roulette? On either side of the wheeled chair walked Polina and
Mlle. Blanche--the latter smiling, modestly jesting, and, in short, making
herself so agreeable to the Grandmother that in the end the old lady relented
towards her. On the other side of the chair Polina had to answer an endless
flow of petty questions--such as “Who was it passed just now?” “Who is that
coming along?” “Is the town a large one?” “Are the public gardens extensive?”
“What sort of trees are those?” “What is the name of those hills?” “Do I see
eagles flying yonder?” “What is that absurd-looking building?” and so forth.
Meanwhile Astley whispered to me, as he walked by my side, that he looked for
much to happen that morning. Behind the old lady’s chair marched Potapitch
and Martha--Potapitch in his frockcoat and white waistcoat, with a cloak over
all, and the forty-year-old and rosy, but slightly grey-headed, Martha in a
mobcap, cotton dress, and squeaking shoes. Frequently the old lady would
75
twist herself round to converse with these servants. As for De Griers, he spoke
as though he had made up his mind to do something (though it is also possible
that he spoke in this manner merely in order to hearten the General, with
whom he appeared to have held a conference). But, alas, the Grandmother had
uttered the fatal words, “I am not going to give you any of my money;” and
though De Griers might regard these words lightly, the General knew his
mother better. Also, I noticed that De Griers and Mlle. Blanche were still
exchanging looks; while of the Prince and the German savant I lost sight at the
end of the Avenue, where they had turned back and left us.
Into the Casino we marched in triumph. At once, both in the person of the
commissionaire and in the persons of the footmen, there sprang to life the
same reverence as had arisen in the lacqueys of the hotel. Yet it was not
without some curiosity that they eyed us.
Without loss of time, the Grandmother gave orders that she should be wheeled
through every room in the establishment; of which apartments she praised a
few, while to others she remained indifferent. Concerning everything, however,
she asked questions. Finally we reached the gaming-salons, where a lacquey
who was, acting as guard over the doors, flung them open as though he were a
man possessed.
The Grandmother’s entry into the roulette-salon produced a profound
impression upon the public. Around the tables, and at the further end of the
room where the trente-et-quarante table was set out, there may have been
gathered from 150 to 200 gamblers, ranged in several rows. Those who had
succeeded in pushing their way to the tables were standing with their feet
firmly planted, in order to avoid having to give up their places until they should
have finished their game (since merely to stand looking on--thus occupying a
gambler’s place for nothing--was not permitted). True, chairs were provided
around the tables, but few players made use of them--more especially if there
was a large attendance of the general public; since to stand allowed of a closer
approach; and, therefore, of greater facilities for calculation and staking.
Behind the foremost row were herded a second and a third row of people
awaiting their turn; but sometimes their impatience led these people to stretch
76
a hand through the first row, in order to deposit their stakes. Even third-row
individuals would dart forward to stake; whence seldom did more than five or
ten minutes pass without a scene over disputed money arising at one or
another end of the table. On the other hand, the police of the Casino were an
able body of men; and though to escape the crush was an impossibility,
however much one might wish it, the eight croupiers apportioned to each table
kept an eye upon the stakes, performed the necessary reckoning, and decided
disputes as they arose.
In the last resort they always called in the Casino police, and the disputes
would immediately come to an end. Policemen were stationed about the Casino
in ordinary costume, and mingled with the spectators so as to make it
impossible to recognise them. In particular they kept a lookout for pickpockets
and swindlers, who simply swanned in the roulette salons, and reaped a rich
harvest. Indeed, in every direction money was being filched from pockets or
purses--though, of course, if the attempt miscarried, a great uproar ensued.
One had only to approach a roulette table, begin to play, and then openly grab
some one else’s winnings, for a din to be raised, and the thief to start
vociferating that the stake was HIS; and, if the coup had been carried out with
sufficient skill, and the witnesses wavered at all in their testimony, the thief
would as likely as not succeed in getting away with the money, provided that
the sum was not a large one--not large enough to have attracted the attention
of the croupiers or some fellow-player. Moreover, if it were a stake of
insignificant size, its true owner would sometimes decline to continue the
dispute, rather than become involved in a scandal. Conversely, if the thief was
detected, he was ignominiously expelled the building.
Upon all this the Grandmother gazed with open-eyed curiosity; and, on some
thieves happening to be turned out of the place, she was delighted.
Trente-et-quarante interested her but little; she preferred roulette, with its
ever-revolving wheel. At length she expressed a wish to view the game closer;
whereupon in some mysterious manner, the lacqueys and other officious
agents (especially one or two ruined Poles of the kind who keep offering their
services to successful gamblers and foreigners in general) at once found and
cleared a space for the old lady among the crush, at the very centre of one of
77
the tables, and next to the chief croupier; after which they wheeled her chair
thither. Upon this a number of visitors who were not playing, but only looking
on (particularly some Englishmen with their families), pressed closer forward
towards the table, in order to watch the old lady from among the ranks of the
gamblers. Many a lorgnette I saw turned in her direction, and the croupiers’
hopes rose high that such an eccentric player was about to provide them with
something out of the common. An old lady of seventy-five years who, though
unable to walk, desired to play was not an everyday phenomenon. I too
pressed forward towards the table, and ranged myself by the Grandmother’s
side; while Martha and Potapitch remained somewhere in the background
among the crowd, and the General, Polina, and De Griers, with Mlle. Blanche,
also remained hidden among the spectators.
At first the old lady did no more than watch the gamblers, and ply me, in a
half-whisper, with sharp-broken questions as to who was so-and-so. Especially
did her favour light upon a very young man who was plunging heavily, and had
won (so it was whispered) as much as 40,000 francs, which were lying before
him on the table in a heap of gold and bank-notes. His eyes kept flashing, and
his hands shaking; yet all the while he staked without any sort of
calculation--just what came to his hand, as he kept winning and winning, and
raking and raking in his gains. Around him lacqueys fussed--placing chairs just
behind where he was standing--and clearing the spectators from his vicinity, so
that he should have more room, and not be crowded--the whole done, of
course, in expectation of a generous largesse. From time to time other
gamblers would hand him part of their winnings--being glad to let him stake for
them as much as his hand could grasp; while beside him stood a Pole in a state
of violent, but respectful, agitation, who, also in expectation of a generous
largesse, kept whispering to him at intervals (probably telling him what to
stake, and advising and directing his play). Yet never once did the player throw
him a glance as he staked and staked, and raked in his winnings. Evidently, the
player in question was dead to all besides.
For a few minutes the Grandmother watched him.
“Go and tell him,” suddenly she exclaimed with a nudge at my elbow, “--go and
78
tell him to stop, and to take his money with him, and go home. Presently he
will be losing--yes, losing everything that he has now won.” She seemed almost
breathless with excitement.
“Where is Potapitch?” she continued. “Send Potapitch to speak to him. No, YOU
must tell him, you must tell him,”--here she nudged me again--“for I have not
the least notion where Potapitch is. Sortez, sortez,” she shouted to the young
man, until I leant over in her direction and whispered in her ear that no
shouting was allowed, nor even loud speaking, since to do so disturbed the
calculations of the players, and might lead to our being ejected.
“How provoking!” she retorted. “Then the young man is done for! I suppose he
WISHES to be ruined. Yet I could not bear to see him have to return it all. What
a fool the fellow is!” and the old lady turned sharply away.
On the left, among the players at the other half of the table, a young lady was
playing, with, beside her, a dwarf. Who the dwarf may have been--whether a
relative or a person whom she took with her to act as a foil--I do not know; but
I had noticed her there on previous occasions, since, everyday, she entered the
Casino at one o’clock precisely, and departed at two--thus playing for exactly
one hour. Being well-known to the attendants, she always had a seat provided
for her; and, taking some gold and a few thousand-franc notes out of her
pocket--would begin quietly, coldly, and after much calculation, to stake, and
mark down the figures in pencil on a paper, as though striving to work out a
system according to which, at given moments, the odds might group
themselves. Always she staked large coins, and either lost or won one, two, or
three thousand francs a day, but not more; after which she would depart. The
Grandmother took a long look at her.
“THAT woman is not losing,” she said. “To whom does she belong? Do you
know her? Who is she?”
“She is, I believe, a Frenchwoman,” I replied.
“Ah! A bird of passage, evidently. Besides, I can see that she has her shoes
polished. Now, explain to me the meaning of each round in the game, and the
way in which one ought to stake.”
79
Upon this I set myself to explain the meaning of all the combinations--of “rouge
et noir,” of “pair et impair,” of “manque et passe,” with, lastly, the different
values in the system of numbers. The Grandmother listened attentively, took
notes, put questions in various forms, and laid the whole thing to heart.
Indeed, since an example of each system of stakes kept constantly occurring, a
great deal of information could be assimilated with ease and celerity. The
Grandmother was vastly pleased.
“But what is zero?” she inquired. “Just now I heard the flaxen-haired croupier
call out ‘zero!’ And why does he keep raking in all the money that is on the
table? To think that he should grab the whole pile for himself! What does zero
mean?”
“Zero is what the bank takes for itself. If the wheel stops at that figure,
everything lying on the table becomes the absolute property of the bank. Also,
whenever the wheel has begun to turn, the bank ceases to pay out anything.”
“Then I should receive nothing if I were staking?”
“No; unless by any chance you had PURPOSELY staked on zero; in which case
you would receive thirty-five times the value of your stake.”
“Why thirty-five times, when zero so often turns up? And if so, why do not
more of these fools stake upon it?”
“Because the number of chances against its occurrence is thirty-six.”
“Rubbish! Potapitch, Potapitch! Come here, and I will give you some money.”
The old lady took out of her pocket a tightly-clasped purse, and extracted from
its depths a ten-gulden piece. “Go at once, and stake that upon zero.”
“But, Madame, zero has only this moment turned up,” I remonstrated;
“wherefore, it may not do so again for ever so long. Wait a little, and you may
then have a better chance.”
“Rubbish! Stake, please.”
“Pardon me, but zero might not turn up again until, say, tonight, even though
you had staked thousands upon it. It often happens so.”
80
“Rubbish, rubbish! Who fears the wolf should never enter the forest. What? We
have lost? Then stake again.”
A second ten-gulden piece did we lose, and then I put down a third. The
Grandmother could scarcely remain seated in her chair, so intent was she upon
the little ball as it leapt through the notches of the ever-revolving wheel.
However, the third ten-gulden piece followed the first two. Upon this the
Grandmother went perfectly crazy. She could no longer sit still, and actually
struck the table with her fist when the croupier cried out, “Trente-six,” instead
of the desiderated zero.
“To listen to him!” fumed the old lady. “When will that accursed zero ever turn
up? I cannot breathe until I see it. I believe that that infernal croupier is
PURPOSELY keeping it from turning up. Alexis Ivanovitch, stake TWO golden
pieces this time. The moment we cease to stake, that cursed zero will come
turning up, and we shall get nothing.”
“My good Madame--“
”Stake, stake! It is not YOUR money.”
Accordingly I staked two ten-gulden pieces. The ball went hopping round the
wheel until it began to settle through the notches. Meanwhile the Grandmother
sat as though petrified, with my hand convulsively clutched in hers.
“Zero!” called the croupier.
“There! You see, you see!” cried the old lady, as she turned and faced me,
wreathed in smiles. “I told you so! It was the Lord God himself who suggested
to me to stake those two coins. Now, how much ought I to receive? Why do
they not pay it out to me? Potapitch! Martha! Where are they? What has
become of our party? Potapitch, Potapitch!”
“Presently, Madame,” I whispered. “Potapitch is outside, and they would decline
to admit him to these rooms. See! You are being paid out your money. Pray
take it.” The croupiers were making up a heavy packet of coins, sealed in blue
paper, and containing fifty ten gulden pieces, together with an unsealed packet
containing another twenty. I handed the whole to the old lady in a
81
money-shovel.
“Faites le jeu, messieurs! Faites le jeu, messieurs! Rien ne va plus,” proclaimed
the croupier as once more he invited the company to stake, and prepared to
turn the wheel.
“We shall be too late! He is going to spin again! Stake, stake!” The
Grandmother was in a perfect fever. “Do not hang back! Be quick!” She seemed
almost beside herself, and nudged me as hard as she could.
“Upon what shall I stake, Madame?”
“Upon zero, upon zero! Again upon zero! Stake as much as ever you can. How
much have we got? Seventy ten-gulden pieces? We shall not miss them, so
stake twenty pieces at a time.”
“Think a moment, Madame. Sometimes zero does not turn up for two hundred
rounds in succession. I assure you that you may lose all your capital.”
“You are wrong--utterly wrong. Stake, I tell you! What a chattering tongue you
have! I know perfectly well what I am doing.” The old lady was shaking with
excitement.
“But the rules do not allow of more than 120 gulden being staked upon zero at
a time.”
“How ‘do not allow’? Surely you are wrong? Monsieur, monsieur--“ here she
nudged the croupier who was sitting on her left, and preparing to
spin--“combien zero? Douze? Douze?”
I hastened to translate.
“Oui, Madame,” was the croupier’s polite reply. “No single stake must exceed
four thousand florins. That is the regulation.”
“Then there is nothing else for it. We must risk in gulden.”
“Le jeu est fait!” the croupier called. The wheel revolved, and stopped at thirty.
We had lost!
“Again, again, again! Stake again!” shouted the old lady. Without attempting to
82
oppose her further, but merely shrugging my shoulders, I placed twelve more
ten-gulden pieces upon the table. The wheel whirled around and around, with
the Grandmother simply quaking as she watched its revolutions.
“Does she again think that zero is going to be the winning coup?” thought I, as
I stared at her in astonishment. Yet an absolute assurance of winning was
shining on her face; she looked perfectly convinced that zero was about to be
called again. At length the ball dropped off into one of the notches.
“Zero!” cried the croupier.
“Ah!!!” screamed the old lady as she turned to me in a whirl of triumph.
I myself was at heart a gambler. At that moment I became acutely conscious
both of that fact and of the fact that my hands and knees were shaking, and
that the blood was beating in my brain. Of course this was a rare occasion--an
occasion on which zero had turned up no less than three times within a dozen
rounds; yet in such an event there was nothing so very surprising, seeing that,
only three days ago, I myself had been a witness to zero turning up THREE
TIMES IN SUCCESSION, so that one of the players who was recording the
coups on paper was moved to remark that for several days past zero had never
turned up at all!
With the Grandmother, as with any one who has won a very large sum, the
management settled up with great attention and respect, since she was
fortunate to have to receive no less than 4200 gulden. Of these gulden the odd
200 were paid her in gold, and the remainder in bank notes.
This time the old lady did not call for Potapitch; for that she was too
preoccupied. Though not outwardly shaken by the event (indeed, she seemed
perfectly calm), she was trembling inwardly from head to foot. At length,
completely absorbed in the game, she burst out:
“Alexis Ivanovitch, did not the croupier just say that 4000 florins were the most
that could be staked at any one time? Well, take these 4000, and stake them
upon the red.”
To oppose her was useless. Once more the wheel revolved.
83
“Rouge!” proclaimed the croupier.
Again 4000 florins--in all 8000!
“Give me them,” commanded the Grandmother, “and stake the other 4000
upon the red again.”
I did so.
“Rouge!” proclaimed the croupier.
“Twelve thousand!” cried the old lady. “Hand me the whole lot. Put the gold
into this purse here, and count the bank notes. Enough! Let us go home. Wheel
my chair away.”
XI
THE chair, with the old lady beaming in it, was wheeled away towards the doors
at the further end of the salon, while our party hastened to crowd around her,
and to offer her their congratulations. In fact, eccentric as was her conduct, it
was also overshadowed by her triumph; with the result that the General no
longer feared to be publicly compromised by being seen with such a strange
woman, but, smiling in a condescending, cheerfully familiar way, as though he
were soothing a child, he offered his greetings to the old lady. At the same
time, both he and the rest of the spectators were visibly impressed.
Everywhere people kept pointing to the Grandmother, and talking about her.
Many people even walked beside her chair, in order to view her the better
while, at a little distance, Astley was carrying on a conversation on the subject
with two English acquaintances of his. De Griers was simply overflowing with
smiles and compliments, and a number of fine ladies were staring at the
Grandmother as though she had been something curious.
“Quelle victoire!” exclaimed De Griers.
“Mais, Madame, c’etait du feu!” added Mlle. Blanche with an elusive smile.
“Yes, I have won twelve thousand florins,” replied the old lady. “And then there
is all this gold. With it the total ought to come to nearly thirteen thousand. How
84
much is that in Russian money? Six thousand roubles, I think?”
However, I calculated that the sum would exceed seven thousand roubles--or,
at the present rate of exchange, even eight thousand.
“Eight thousand roubles! What a splendid thing! And to think of you simpletons
sitting there and doing nothing! Potapitch! Martha! See what I have won!”
“How DID you do it, Madame?” Martha exclaimed ecstatically. “Eight thousand
roubles!”
“And I am going to give you fifty gulden apiece. There they are.”
Potapitch and Martha rushed towards her to kiss her hand.
“And to each bearer also I will give a ten-gulden piece. Let them have it out of
the gold, Alexis Ivanovitch. But why is this footman bowing to me, and that
other man as well? Are they congratulating me? Well, let them have ten gulden
apiece.”
“Madame la princesse--Un pauvre expatrie--Malheur continuel--Les princes
russes sont si genereux!” said a man who for some time past had been hanging
around the old lady’s chair--a personage who, dressed in a shabby frockcoat
and coloured waistcoat, kept taking off his cap, and smiling pathetically.
“Give him ten gulden,” said the Grandmother. “No, give him twenty. Now,
enough of that, or I shall never get done with you all. Take a moment’s rest,
and then carry me away. Prascovia, I mean to buy a new dress for you
tomorrow. Yes, and for you too, Mlle. Blanche. Please translate, Prascovia.”
“Merci, Madame,” replied Mlle. Blanche gratefully as she twisted her face into
the mocking smile which usually she kept only for the benefit of De Griers and
the General. The latter looked confused, and seemed greatly relieved when we
reached the Avenue.
“How surprised Theodosia too will be!” went on the Grandmother (thinking of
the General’s nursemaid). “She, like yourselves, shall have the price of a new
gown. Here, Alexis Ivanovitch! Give that beggar something” (a crooked-backed
ragamuffin had approached to stare at us).
85
“But perhaps he is NOT a beggar--only a rascal,” I replied.
“Never mind, never mind. Give him a gulden.”
I approached the beggar in question, and handed him the coin. Looking at me
in great astonishment, he silently accepted the gulden, while from his person
there proceeded a strong smell of liquor.
“Have you never tried your luck, Alexis Ivanovitch?”
“No, Madame.”
“Yet just now I could see that you were burning to do so?”
“I do mean to try my luck presently.”
“Then stake everything upon zero. You have seen how it ought to be done?
How much capital do you possess?”
“Two hundred gulden, Madame.”
“Not very much. See here; I will lend you five hundred if you wish. Take this
purse of mine.” With that she added sharply to the General: “But YOU need not
expect to receive any.”
This seemed to upset him, but he said nothing, and De Griers contented
himself by scowling.
“Que diable!” he whispered to the General. “C’est une terrible vieille.”
“Look! Another beggar, another beggar!” exclaimed the grandmother. “Alexis
Ivanovitch, go and give him a gulden.”
As she spoke I saw approaching us a grey-headed old man with a wooden
leg--a man who was dressed in a blue frockcoat and carrying a staff. He looked
like an old soldier. As soon as I tendered him the coin he fell back a step or
two, and eyed me threateningly.
“Was ist der Teufel!” he cried, and appended thereto a round dozen of oaths.
“The man is a perfect fool!” exclaimed the Grandmother, waving her hand.
“Move on now, for I am simply famished. When we have lunched we will return
86
to that place.”
“What?” cried I. “You are going to play again?”
“What else do you suppose?” she retorted. “Are you going only to sit here, and
grow sour, and let me look at you?”
“Madame,” said De Griers confidentially, “les chances peuvent tourner. Une
seule mauvaise chance, et vous perdrez tout--surtout avec votre jeu. C’etait
terrible!”
“Oui; vous perdrez absolument,” put in Mlle. Blanche.
“What has that got to do with YOU?” retorted the old lady. “It is not YOUR
money that I am going to lose; it is my own. And where is that Mr. Astley of
yours?” she added to myself.
“He stayed behind in the Casino.”
“What a pity! He is such a nice sort of man!”
Arriving home, and meeting the landlord on the staircase, the Grandmother
called him to her side, and boasted to him of her winnings--thereafter doing the
same to Theodosia, and conferring upon her thirty gulden; after which she bid
her serve luncheon. The meal over, Theodosia and Martha broke into a joint
flood of ecstasy.
“I was watching you all the time, Madame,” quavered Martha, “and I asked
Potapitch what mistress was trying to do. And, my word! the heaps and heaps
of money that were lying upon the table! Never in my life have I seen so much
money. And there were gentlefolk around it, and other gentlefolk sitting down.
So, I asked Potapitch where all these gentry had come from; for, thought I,
maybe the Holy Mother of God will help our mistress among them. Yes, I
prayed for you, Madame, and my heart died within me, so that I kept trembling
and trembling. The Lord be with her, I thought to myself; and in answer to my
prayer He has now sent you what He has done! Even yet I tremble--I tremble
to think of it all.”
“Alexis Ivanovitch,” said the old lady, “after luncheon,--that is to say, about
87
four o’clock--get ready to go out with me again. But in the meanwhile,
good-bye. Do not forget to call a doctor, for I must take the waters. Now go
and get rested a little.”
I left the Grandmother’s presence in a state of bewilderment.
Vainly I endeavoured to imagine what would become of our party, or what turn
the affair would next take. I could perceive that none of the party had yet
recovered their presence of mind--least of all the General. The factor of the
Grandmother’s appearance in place of the hourly expected telegram to
announce her death (with, of course, resultant legacies) had so upset the whole
scheme of intentions and projects that it was with a decided feeling of
apprehension and growing paralysis that the conspirators viewed any future
performances of the old lady at roulette. Yet this second factor was not quite so
important as the first, since, though the Grandmother had twice declared that
she did not intend to give the General any money, that declaration was not a
complete ground for the abandonment of hope. Certainly De Griers, who, with
the General, was up to the neck in the affair, had not wholly lost courage; and I
felt sure that Mlle. Blanche also--Mlle. Blanche who was not only as deeply
involved as the other two, but also expectant of becoming Madame General and
an important legatee--would not lightly surrender the position, but would use
her every resource of coquetry upon the old lady, in order to afford a contrast
to the impetuous Polina, who was difficult to understand, and lacked the art of
pleasing.
Yet now, when the Grandmother had just performed an astonishing feat at
roulette; now, when the old lady’s personality had been so clearly and typically
revealed as that of a rugged, arrogant woman who was “tombee en enfance”;
now, when everything appeared to be lost,--why, now the Grandmother was as
merry as a child which plays with thistle-down. “Good Lord!” I thought with,
may God forgive me, a most malicious smile, “every ten-gulden piece which the
Grandmother staked must have raised a blister on the General’s heart, and
maddened De Griers, and driven Mlle. de Cominges almost to frenzy with the
sight of this spoon dangling before her lips.” Another factor is the circumstance
that even when, overjoyed at winning, the Grandmother was distributing alms
88
right and left, and taking every one to be a beggar, she again snapped out to
the General that he was not going to be allowed any of her money--which
meant that the old lady had quite made up her mind on the point, and was sure
of it. Yes, danger loomed ahead.
All these thoughts passed through my mind during the few moments that,
having left the old lady’s rooms, I was ascending to my own room on the top
storey. What most struck me was the fact that, though I had divined the chief,
the stoutest, threads which united the various actors in the drama, I had, until
now, been ignorant of the methods and secrets of the game. For Polina had
never been completely open with me. Although, on occasions, it had happened
that involuntarily, as it were, she had revealed to me something of her heart, I
had noticed that in most cases--in fact, nearly always--she had either laughed
away these revelations, or grown confused, or purposely imparted to them a
false guise. Yes, she must have concealed a great deal from me. But, I had a
presentiment that now the end of this strained and mysterious situation was
approaching. Another stroke, and all would be finished and exposed. Of my
own fortunes, interested though I was in the affair, I took no account. I was in
the strange position of possessing but two hundred gulden, of being at a loose
end, of lacking both a post, the means of subsistence, a shred of hope, and any
plans for the future, yet of caring nothing for these things. Had not my mind
been so full of Polina, I should have given myself up to the comical piquancy of
the impending denouement, and laughed my fill at it. But the thought of Polina
was torture to me. That her fate was settled I already had an inkling; yet that
was not the thought which was giving me so much uneasiness. What I really
wished for was to penetrate her secrets. I wanted her to come to me and say, “
I love you, “ and, if she would not so come, or if to hope that she would ever
do so was an unthinkable absurdity--why, then there was nothing else for me
to want. Even now I do not know what I am wanting. I feel like a man who has
lost his way. I yearn but to be in her presence, and within the circle of her light
and splendour--to be there now, and forever, and for the whole of my life. More
I do not know. How can I ever bring myself to leave her?
On reaching the third storey of the hotel I experienced a shock. I was just
passing the General’s suite when something caused me to look round. Out of a
89
door about twenty paces away there was coming Polina! She hesitated for a
moment on seeing me, and then beckoned me to her.
“Polina Alexandrovna!”
“Hush! Not so loud.”
“Something startled me just now,” I whispered, “and I looked round, and saw
you. Some electrical influence seems to emanate from your form.”
“Take this letter,” she went on with a frown (probably she had not even heard
my words, she was so preoccupied), “and hand it personally to Mr. Astley. Go
as quickly as ever you can, please. No answer will be required. He himself--“
She did not finish her sentence.
“To Mr. Astley?” I asked, in some astonishment.
But she had vanished again.
Aha! So the two were carrying on a correspondence! However, I set off to
search for Astley--first at his hotel, and then at the Casino, where I went the
round of the salons in vain. At length, vexed, and almost in despair, I was on
my way home when I ran across him among a troop of English ladies and
gentlemen who had been out for a ride. Beckoning to him to stop, I handed
him the letter. We had barely time even to look at one another, but I suspected
that it was of set purpose that he restarted his horse so quickly.
Was jealousy, then, gnawing at me? At all events, I felt exceedingly depressed,
despite the fact that I had no desire to ascertain what the correspondence was
about. To think that HE should be her confidant! “My friend, mine own familiar
friend!” passed through my mind. Yet WAS there any love in the matter? “Of
course not,” reason whispered to me. But reason goes for little on such
occasions. I felt that the matter must be cleared up, for it was becoming
unpleasantly complex.
I had scarcely set foot in the hotel when the commissionaire and the landlord
(the latter issuing from his room for the purpose) alike informed me that I was
being searched for high and low--that three separate messages to ascertain my
90
whereabouts had come down from the General. When I entered his study I was
feeling anything but kindly disposed. I found there the General himself, De
Griers, and Mlle. Blanche, but not Mlle.’s mother, who was a person whom her
reputed daughter used only for show purposes, since in all matters of business
the daughter fended for herself, and it is unlikely that the mother knew
anything about them.
Some very heated discussion was in progress, and meanwhile the door of the
study was open--an unprecedented circumstance. As I approached the portals I
could hear loud voices raised, for mingled with the pert, venomous accents of
De Griers were Mlle. Blanche’s excited, impudently abusive tongue and the
General’s plaintive wail as, apparently, he sought to justify himself in
something. But on my appearance every one stopped speaking, and tried to
put a better face upon matters. De Griers smoothed his hair, and twisted his
angry face into a smile--into the mean, studiedly polite French smile which I so
detested; while the downcast, perplexed General assumed an air of
dignity--though only in a mechanical way. On the other hand, Mlle. Blanche did
not trouble to conceal the wrath that was sparkling in her countenance, but
bent her gaze upon me with an air of impatient expectancy. I may remark that
hitherto she had treated me with absolute superciliousness, and, so far from
answering my salutations, had always ignored them.
“Alexis Ivanovitch,” began the General in a tone of affectionate upbraiding,
“may I say to you that I find it strange, exceedingly strange, that--In short,
your conduct towards myself and my family--In a word, your-er-extremely”
“ Eh! Ce n’est pas ca,” interrupted De Griers in a tone of impatience and
contempt (evidently he was the ruling spirit of the conclave). “Mon cher
monsieur, notre general se trompe. What he means to say is that he warns
you--he begs of you most eamestly--not to ruin him. I use the expression
because--“
”Why? Why?” I interjected.
“Because you have taken upon yourself to act as guide to this, to this--how
shall I express it?--to this old lady, a cette pauvre terrible vieille. But she will
91
only gamble away all that she has--gamble it away like thistledown. You
yourself have seen her play. Once she has acquired the taste for gambling, she
will never leave the roulette-table, but, of sheer perversity and temper, will
stake her all, and lose it. In cases such as hers a gambler can never be torn
away from the game; and then--and then--“
”And then,” asseverated the General, “you will have ruined my whole family. I
and my family are her heirs, for she has no nearer relatives than ourselves. I
tell you frankly that my affairs are in great--very great disorder; how much
they are so you yourself are partially aware. If she should lose a large sum, or,
maybe, her whole fortune, what will become of us--of my children” (here the
General exchanged a glance with De Griers)” or of me? “(here he looked at
Mlle. Blanche, who turned her head contemptuously away). “Alexis Ivanovitch,
I beg of you to save us.”
“Tell me, General, how am I to do so? On what footing do I stand here?”
“Refuse to take her about. Simply leave her alone.”
“But she would soon find some one else to take my place?”
“Ce n’est pas ca, ce n’est pas ca,” again interrupted De Griers. “Que diable! Do
not leave her alone so much as advise her, persuade her, draw her away. In
any case do not let her gamble; find her some counter-attraction.”
“And how am I to do that? If only you would undertake the task, Monsieur de
Griers! “ I said this last as innocently as possible, but at once saw a rapid
glance of excited interrogation pass from Mlle. Blanche to De Griers, while in
the face of the latter also there gleamed something which he could not repress.
“Well, at the present moment she would refuse to accept my services,” said he
with a gesture. “But if, later--“
Here he gave Mlle. Blanche another glance which was full of meaning;
whereupon she advanced towards me with a bewitching smile, and seized and
pressed my hands. Devil take it, but how that devilish visage of hers could
change! At the present moment it was a visage full of supplication, and as
gentle in its expression as that of a smiling, roguish infant. Stealthily, she drew
92
me apart from the rest as though the more completely to separate me from
them; and, though no harm came of her doing so--for it was merely a stupid
manoeuvre, and no more--I found the situation very unpleasant.
The General hastened to lend her his support.
“Alexis Ivanovitch,” he began, “pray pardon me for having said what I did just
now--for having said more than I meant to do. I beg and beseech you, I kiss
the hem of your garment, as our Russian saying has it, for you, and only you,
can save us. I and Mlle. de Cominges, we all of us beg of you--But you
understand, do you not? Surely you understand?” and with his eyes he
indicated Mlle. Blanche. Truly he was cutting a pitiful figure!
At this moment three low, respectful knocks sounded at the door; which, on
being opened, revealed a chambermaid, with Potapitch behind her--come from
the Grandmother to request that I should attend her in her rooms. “She is in a
bad humour,” added Potapitch.
The time was half-past three.
“My mistress was unable to sleep,” explained Potapitch; “so, after tossing about
for a while, she suddenly rose, called for her chair, and sent me to look for you.
She is now in the verandah.”
“Quelle megere!” exclaimed De Griers.
True enough, I found Madame in the hotel verandah -much put about at my
delay, for she had been unable to contain herself until four o’clock.
“Lift me up,” she cried to the bearers, and once more we set out for the
roulette-salons.
XII
The Grandmother was in an impatient, irritable frame of mind. Without doubt
the roulette had turned her head, for she appeared to be indifferent to
everything else, and, in general, seemed much distraught. For instance, she
asked me no questions about objects en route, except that, when a sumptuous
93
barouche passed us and raised a cloud of dust, she lifted her hand for a
moment, and inquired, “ What was that? “ Yet even then she did not appear to
hear my reply, although at times her abstraction was interrupted by sallies and
fits of sharp, impatient fidgeting. Again, when I pointed out to her the Baron
and Baroness Burmergelm walking to the Casino, she merely looked at them in
an absent-minded sort of way, and said with complete indifference, “Ah!” Then,
turning sharply to Potapitch and Martha, who were walking behind us, she
rapped out:
“Why have YOU attached yourselves to the party? We are not going to take you
with us every time. Go home at once.” Then, when the servants had pulled
hasty bows and departed, she added to me: “You are all the escort I need.”
At the Casino the Grandmother seemed to be expected, for no time was lost in
procuring her former place beside the croupier. It is my opinion that though
croupiers seem such ordinary, humdrum officials--men who care nothing
whether the bank wins or loses--they are, in reality, anything but indifferent to
the bank’s losing, and are given instructions to attract players, and to keep a
watch over the bank’s interests; as also, that for such services, these officials
are awarded prizes and premiums. At all events, the croupiers of Roulettenberg
seemed to look upon the Grandmother as their lawful prey--whereafter there
befell what our party had foretold.
It happened thus:
As soon as ever we arrived the Grandmother ordered me to stake twelve
ten-gulden pieces in succession upon zero. Once, twice, and thrice I did so, yet
zero never turned up.
“Stake again,” said the old lady with an impatient nudge of my elbow, and I
obeyed.
“How many times have we lost? “ she inquired--actually grinding her teeth in
her excitement.
“We have lost 144 ten-gulden pieces,” I replied. “I tell you, Madame, that zero
may not turn up until nightfall.”
94
“Never mind,” she interrupted. “Keep on staking upon zero, and also stake a
thousand gulden upon rouge. Here is a banknote with which to do so.”
The red turned up, but zero missed again, and we only got our thousand
gulden back.
“But you see, you see “ whispered the old lady. “We have now recovered
almost all that we staked. Try zero again. Let us do so another ten times, and
then leave off.”
By the fifth round, however, the Grandmother was weary of the scheme.
“To the devil with that zero!” she exclaimed. Stake four thousand gulden upon
the red.”
“But, Madame, that will be so much to venture!” I remonstrated. “Suppose the
red should not turn up?” The Grandmother almost struck me in her excitement.
Her agitation was rapidly making her quarrelsome. Consequently, there was
nothing for it but to stake the whole four thousand gulden as she had directed.
The wheel revolved while the Grandmother sat as bolt upright, and with as
proud and quiet a mien, as though she had not the least doubt of winning.
“Zero!” cried the croupier.
At first the old lady failed to understand the situation; but, as soon as she saw
the croupier raking in her four thousand gulden, together with everything else
that happened to be lying on the table, and recognised that the zero which had
been so long turning up, and on which we had lost nearly two hundred
ten-gulden pieces, had at length, as though of set purpose, made a sudden
reappearance--why, the poor old lady fell to cursing it, and to throwing herself
about, and wailing and gesticulating at the company at large. Indeed, some
people in our vicinity actually burst out laughing.
“To think that that accursed zero should have turned up NOW!” she sobbed.
“The accursed, accursed thing! And, it is all YOUR fault,” she added, rounding
upon me in a frenzy. “It was you who persuaded me to cease staking upon it.”
“But, Madame, I only explained the game to you. How am I to answer for every
95
mischance which may occur in it?”
“You and your mischances!” she whispered threateningly. “Go! Away at once!”
“Farewell, then, Madame.” And I turned to depart.
“No--stay,” she put in hastily. “Where are you going to? Why should you leave
me? You fool! No, no... stay here. It is I who was the fool. Tell me what I ought
to do.”
“I cannot take it upon myself to advise you, for you will only blame me if I do
so. Play at your own discretion. Say exactly what you wish staked, and I will
stake it.”
“Very well. Stake another four thousand gulden upon the red. Take this
banknote to do it with. I have still got twenty thousand roubles in actual cash.”
“But,” I whispered, “such a quantity of money--“
”Never mind. I cannot rest until I have won back my losses. Stake!”
I staked, and we lost.
“Stake again, stake again--eight thousand at a stroke!”
“I cannot, Madame. The largest stake allowed is four thousand gulden.”
“Well, then; stake four thousand.”
This time we won, and the Grandmother recovered herself a little.
“You see, you see!” she exclaimed as she nudged me. “Stake another four
thousand.”
I did so, and lost. Again, and yet again, we lost. “Madame, your twelve
thousand gulden are now gone,” at length I reported.
“I see they are,” she replied with, as it were, the calmness of despair. “I see
they are,” she muttered again as she gazed straight in front of her, like a
person lost in thought. “Ah well, I do not mean to rest until I have staked
another four thousand.”
96
“But you have no money with which to do it, Madame. In this satchel I can see
only a few five percent bonds and some transfers--no actual cash.”
“And in the purse?”
“A mere trifle.”
“But there is a money-changer’s office here, is there not? They told me I should
be able to get any sort of paper security changed! “
”Quite so; to any amount you please. But you will lose on the transaction what
would frighten even a Jew.”
“Rubbish! I am DETERMINED to retrieve my losses. Take me away, and call
those fools of bearers.”
I wheeled the chair out of the throng, and, the bearers making their
appearance, we left the Casino.
“Hurry, hurry!” commanded the Grandmother. “Show me the nearest way to
the money-changer’s. Is it far?”
“A couple of steps, Madame.”
At the turning from the square into the Avenue we came face to face with the
whole of our party--the General, De Griers, Mlle. Blanche, and her mother. Only
Polina and Mr. Astley were absent.
“Well, well, well! “ exclaimed the Grandmother. “But we have no time to stop.
What do you want? I can’t talk to you here.”
I dropped behind a little, and immediately was pounced upon by De Griers.
“She has lost this morning’s winnings,” I whispered, “and also twelve thousand
gulden of her original money. At the present moment we are going to get some
bonds changed.”
De Griers stamped his foot with vexation, and hastened to communicate the
tidings to the General. Meanwhile we continued to wheel the old lady along.
“Stop her, stop her,” whispered the General in consternation.
97
“You had better try and stop her yourself,” I returned--also in a whisper.
“My good mother,” he said as he approached her, “--my good mother, pray let,
let--“ (his voice was beginning to tremble and sink) “--let us hire a carriage,
and go for a drive. Near here there is an enchanting view to be obtained.
We-we-we were just coming to invite you to go and see it.”
“Begone with you and your views!” said the Grandmother angrily as she waved
him away.
“And there are trees there, and we could have tea under them,” continued the
General--now in utter despair.
“Nous boirons du lait, sur l’herbe fraiche,” added De Griers with the snarl
almost of a wild beast.
“Du lait, de l’herbe fraiche”--the idyll, the ideal of the Parisian bourgeois--his
whole outlook upon “la nature et la verite”!
“Have done with you and your milk!” cried the old lady. “Go and stuff
YOURSELF as much as you like, but my stomach simply recoils from the idea.
What are you stopping for? I have nothing to say to you.”
“Here we are, Madame,” I announced. “Here is the moneychanger’s office.”
I entered to get the securities changed, while the Grandmother remained
outside in the porch, and the rest waited at a little distance, in doubt as to their
best course of action. At length the old lady turned such an angry stare upon
them that they departed along the road towards the Casino.
The process of changing involved complicated calculations which soon
necessitated my return to the Grandmother for instructions.
“The thieves!” she exclaimed as she clapped her hands together. “Never mind,
though. Get the documents cashed--No; send the banker out to me,” she
added as an afterthought.
“Would one of the clerks do, Madame?”
“Yes, one of the clerks. The thieves!”
98
The clerk consented to come out when he perceived that he was being asked
for by an old lady who was too infirm to walk; after which the Grandmother
began to upbraid him at length, and with great vehemence, for his alleged
usuriousness, and to bargain with him in a mixture of Russian, French, and
German--I acting as interpreter. Meanwhile, the grave-faced official eyed us
both, and silently nodded his head. At the Grandmother, in particular, he gazed
with a curiosity which almost bordered upon rudeness. At length, too, he
smiled.
“Pray recollect yourself!” cried the old lady. “And may my money choke you!
Alexis Ivanovitch, tell him that we can easily repair to someone else.”
“The clerk says that others will give you even less than he.”
Of what the ultimate calculations consisted I do not exactly remember, but at
all events they were alarming. Receiving twelve thousand florins in gold, I took
also the statement of accounts, and carried it out to the Grandmother.
“Well, well,” she said, “I am no accountant. Let us hurry away, hurry away.”
And she waved the paper aside.
“Neither upon that accursed zero, however, nor upon that equally accursed red
do I mean to stake a cent,” I muttered to myself as I entered the Casino.
This time I did all I could to persuade the old lady to stake as little as
possible--saying that a turn would come in the chances when she would be at
liberty to stake more. But she was so impatient that, though at first she agreed
to do as I suggested, nothing could stop her when once she had begun. By way
of prelude she won stakes of a hundred and two hundred gulden.
“There you are!” she said as she nudged me. “See what we have won! Surely it
would be worth our while to stake four thousand instead of a hundred, for we
might win another four thousand, and then--! Oh, it was YOUR fault before--all
your fault!”
I felt greatly put out as I watched her play, but I decided to hold my tongue,
and to give her no more advice.
99
Suddenly De Griers appeared on the scene. It seemed that all this while he and
his companions had been standing beside us-- though I noticed that Mlle.
Blanche had withdrawn a little from the rest, and was engaged in flirting with
the Prince. Clearly the General was greatly put out at this. Indeed, he was in a
perfect agony of vexation. But Mlle. was careful never to look his way, though
he did his best to attract her notice. Poor General! By turns his face blanched
and reddened, and he was trembling to such an extent that he could scarcely
follow the old lady’s play. At length Mlle. and the Prince took their departure,
and the General followed them.
“Madame, Madame,” sounded the honeyed accents of De Griers as he leant
over to whisper in the Grandmother’s ear. “That stake will never win. No, no, it
is impossible,” he added in Russian with a writhe. “No, no!”
“But why not?” asked the Grandmother, turning round. “Show me what I ought
to do.”
Instantly De Griers burst into a babble of French as he advised, jumped about,
declared that such and such chances ought to be waited for, and started to
make calculations of figures. All this he addressed to me in my capacity as
translator--tapping the table the while with his finger, and pointing hither and
thither. At length he seized a pencil, and began to reckon sums on paper until
he had exhausted the Grandmother’s patience.
“Away with you!” she interrupted. “You talk sheer nonsense, for, though you
keep on saying ‘Madame, Madame,’ you haven’t the least notion what ought to
be done. Away with you, I say!”
“Mais, Madame,” cooed De Griers--and straightway started afresh with his
fussy instructions.
“Stake just ONCE, as he advises,” the Grandmother said to me, “and then we
shall see what we shall see. Of course, his stake MIGHT win.”
As a matter of fact, De Grier’s one object was to distract the old lady from
staking large sums; wherefore, he now suggested to her that she should stake
upon certain numbers, singly and in groups. Consequently, in accordance with
100
his instructions, I staked a ten-gulden piece upon several odd numbers in the
first twenty, and five ten-gulden pieces upon certain groups of numbers-groups
of from twelve to eighteen, and from eighteen to twenty-four. The total staked
amounted to 160 gulden.
The wheel revolved. “Zero!” cried the croupier.
We had lost it all!
“The fool!” cried the old lady as she turned upon De Griers. “You infernal
Frenchman, to think that you should advise! Away with you! Though you fuss
and fuss, you don’t even know what you’re talking about.”
Deeply offended, De Griers shrugged his shoulders, favoured the Grandmother
with a look of contempt, and departed. For some time past he had been feeling
ashamed of being seen in such company, and this had proved the last straw.
An hour later we had lost everything in hand.
“Home!” cried the Grandmother.
Not until we had turned into the Avenue did she utter a word; but from that
point onwards, until we arrived at the hotel, she kept venting exclamations of
“What a fool I am! What a silly old fool I am, to be sure!”
Arrived at the hotel, she called for tea, and then gave orders for her luggage to
be packed.
“We are off again,” she announced.
“But whither, Madame?” inquired Martha.
“What business is that of YOURS? Let the cricket stick to its hearth. [The
Russian form of “Mind your own business.”] Potapitch, have everything packed,
for we are returning to Moscow at once. I have fooled away fifteen thousand
roubles.”
“Fifteen thousand roubles, good mistress? My God!” And Potapitch spat upon
his hands--probably to show that he was ready to serve her in any way he
could.
101
“Now then, you fool! At once you begin with your weeping and wailing! Be
quiet, and pack. Also, run downstairs, and get my hotel bill.”
“The next train leaves at 9:30, Madame,” I interposed, with a view to checking
her agitation.
“And what is the time now?”
“Half-past eight.”
“How vexing! But, never mind. Alexis Ivanovitch, I have not a kopeck left; I
have but these two bank notes. Please run to the office and get them changed.
Otherwise I shall have nothing to travel with.”
Departing on her errand, I returned half an hour later to find the whole party
gathered in her rooms. It appeared that the news of her impending departure
for Moscow had thrown the conspirators into consternation even greater than
her losses had done. For, said they, even if her departure should save her
fortune, what will become of the General later? And who is to repay De Griers?
Clearly Mlle. Blanche would never consent to wait until the Grandmother was
dead, but would at once elope with the Prince or someone else. So they had all
gathered together--endeavouring to calm and dissuade the Grandmother. Only
Polina was absent. For her part the Grandmother had nothing for the party but
abuse.
“Away with you, you rascals!” she was shouting. “What have my affairs to do
with you? Why, in particular, do you”--here she indicated De Griers--“come
sneaking here with your goat’s beard? And what do YOU”--here she turned to
Mlle. Blanche “want of me? What are YOU finicking for?”
“Diantre!” muttered Mlle. under her breath, but her eyes were flashing. Then all
at once she burst into a laugh and left the room--crying to the General as she
did so: “Elle vivra cent ans!”
“So you have been counting upon my death, have you?” fumed the old lady.
“Away with you! Clear them out of the room, Alexis Ivanovitch. What business
is it of THEIRS? It is not THEIR money that I have been squandering, but my
own.”
102
The General shrugged his shoulders, bowed, and withdrew, with De Griers
behind him.
“Call Prascovia,” commanded the Grandmother, and in five minutes Martha
reappeared with Polina, who had been sitting with the children in her own room
(having purposely determined not to leave it that day). Her face looked grave
and careworn.
“Prascovia,” began the Grandmother, “is what I have just heard through a side
wind true--namely, that this fool of a stepfather of yours is going to marry that
silly whirligig of a Frenchwoman--that actress, or something worse? Tell me, is
it true?”
“I do not know FOR CERTAIN, Grandmamma,” replied Polina; “but from Mlle.
Blanche’s account (for she does not appear to think it necessary to conceal
anything) I conclude that--“
”You need not say any more,” interrupted the Grandmother energetically. “I
understand the situation. I always thought we should get something like this
from him, for I always looked upon him as a futile, frivolous fellow who gave
himself unconscionable airs on the fact of his being a general (though he only
became one because he retired as a colonel). Yes, I know all about the sending
of the telegrams to inquire whether ‘the old woman is likely to turn up her toes
soon.’ Ah, they were looking for the legacies! Without money that wretched
woman (what is her name?--Oh, De Cominges) would never dream of accepting
the General and his false teeth--no, not even for him to be her lacquey--since
she herself, they say, possesses a pile of money, and lends it on interest, and
makes a good thing out of it. However, it is not you, Prascovia, that I am
blaming; it was not you who sent those telegrams. Nor, for that matter, do I
wish to recall old scores. True, I know that you are a vixen by nature--that you
are a wasp which will sting one if one touches it--yet, my heart is sore for you,
for I loved your mother, Katerina. Now, will you leave everything here, and
come away with me? Otherwise, I do not know what is to become of you, and it
is not right that you should continue living with these people. Nay,” she
interposed, the moment that Polina attempted to speak, “I have not yet
finished. I ask of you nothing in return. My house in Moscow is, as you know,
103
large enough for a palace, and you could occupy a whole floor of it if you liked,
and keep away from me for weeks together. Will you come with me or will you
not?”
“First of all, let me ask of YOU,” replied Polina, “whether you are intending to
depart at once?”
“What? You suppose me to be jesting? I have said that I am going, and I AM
going. Today I have squandered fifteen thousand roubles at that accursed
roulette of yours, and though, five years ago, I promised the people of a
certain suburb of Moscow to build them a stone church in place of a wooden
one, I have been fooling away my money here! However, I am going back now
to build my church.”
“But what about the waters, Grandmamma? Surely you came here to take the
waters?”
“You and your waters! Do not anger me, Prascovia. Surely you are trying to?
Say, then: will you, or will you not, come with me?”
“Grandmamma,” Polina replied with deep feeling, “I am very, very grateful to
you for the shelter which you have so kindly offered me. Also, to a certain
extent you have guessed my position aright, and I am beholden to you to such
an extent that it may be that I will come and live with you, and that very soon;
yet there are important reasons why--why I cannot make up my min,d just yet.
If you would let me have, say, a couple of weeks to decide in--?”
“You mean that you are NOT coming?”
“I mean only that I cannot come just yet. At all events, I could not well leave
my little brother and sister here, since,since--if I were to leave them--they
would be abandoned altogether. But if, Grandmamma, you would take the little
ones AND myself, then, of course, I could come with you, and would do all I
could to serve you” (this she said with great earnestness). “Only, without the
little ones I CANNOT come.”
“Do not make a fuss” (as a matter of fact Polina never at any time either fussed
or wept). “The Great Foster--Father [Translated literally--The Great Poulterer]
104
can find for all his chicks a place. You are not coming without the children? But
see here, Prascovia. I wish you well, and nothing but well: yet I have divined
the reason why you will not come. Yes, I know all, Prascovia. That Frenchman
will never bring you good of any sort.”
Polina coloured hotly, and even I started. “For,” thought I to myself, “every one
seems to know about that affair. Or perhaps I am the only one who does not
know about it? “
”Now, now! Do not frown,” continued the Grandmother. “But I do not intend to
slur things over. You will take care that no harm befalls you, will you not? For
you are a girl of sense, and I am sorry for you--I regard you in a different light
to the rest of them. And now, please, leave me. Good-bye.”
“But let me stay with you a little longer,” said Polina.
“No,” replied the other; “you need not. Do not bother me, for you and all of
them have tired me out.”
Yet when Polina tried to kiss the Grandmother’s hand, the old lady withdrew it,
and herself kissed the girl on the cheek. As she passed me, Polina gave me a
momentary glance, and then as swiftly averted her eyes.
“And good-bye to you, also, Alexis Ivanovitch. The train starts in an hour’s
time, and I think that you must be weary of me. Take these five hundred
gulden for yourself.”
“I thank you humbly, Madame, but I am ashamed to--“
”Come, come!” cried the Grandmother so energetically, and with such an air of
menace, that I did not dare refuse the money further.
“If, when in Moscow, you have no place where you can lay your head,” she
added, “come and see me, and I will give you a recommendation. Now,
Potapitch, get things ready.”
I ascended to my room, and lay down upon the bed. A whole hour I must have
lain thus, with my head resting upon my hand. So the crisis had come! I
needed time for its consideration. To- morrow I would have a talk with Polina.
105
Ah! The Frenchman! So, it was true? But how could it be so? Polina and De
Griers! What a combination!
No, it was too improbable. Suddenly I leapt up with the idea of seeking Astley
and forcing him to speak. There could be no doubt that he knew more than I
did. Astley? Well, he was another problem for me to solve.
Suddenly there came a knock at the door, and I opened it to find Potapitch
awaiting me.
“Sir,” he said, “my mistress is asking for you.”
“Indeed? But she is just departing, is she not? The train leaves in ten minutes’
time.”
“She is uneasy, sir; she cannot rest. Come quickly, sir; do not delay.”
I ran downstairs at once. The Grandmother was just being carried out of her
rooms into the corridor. In her hands she held a roll of bank-notes.
“Alexis Ivanovitch,” she cried, “walk on ahead, and we will set out again.”
“But whither, Madame?”
“I cannot rest until I have retrieved my losses. March on ahead, and ask me no
questions. Play continues until midnight, does it not?”
For a moment I stood stupefied--stood deep in thought; but it was not long
before I had made up my mind.
“With your leave, Madame,” I said, “I will not go with you.”
“And why not? What do you mean? Is every one here a stupid
good-for-nothing?”
“Pardon me, but I have nothing to reproach myself with. I merely will not go. I
merely intend neither to witness nor to join in your play. I also beg to return
you your five hundred gulden. Farewell.”
Laying the money upon a little table which the Grandmother’s chair happened
to be passing, I bowed and withdrew.
106
“What folly!” the Grandmother shouted after me. “Very well, then. Do not
come, and I will find my way alone. Potapitch, you must come with me. Lift up
the chair, and carry me along.”
I failed to find Mr. Astley, and returned home. It was now growing late--it was
past midnight, but I subsequently learnt from Potapitch how the Grandmother’s
day had ended. She had lost all the money which, earlier in the day, I had got
for her paper securities--a sum amounting to about ten thousand roubles. This
she did under the direction of the Pole whom, that afternoon, she had dowered
with two ten-gulden pieces. But before his arrival on the scene, she had
commanded Potapitch to stake for her; until at length she had told him also to
go about his business. Upon that the Pole had leapt into the breach. Not only
did it happen that he knew the Russian language, but also he could speak a
mixture of three different dialects, so that the pair were able to understand one
another. Yet the old lady never ceased to abuse him, despite his deferential
manner, and to compare him unfavourably with myself (so, at all events,
Potapitch declared). “You,” the old chamberlain said to me, “treated her as a
gentleman should, but he--he robbed her right and left, as I could see with my
own eyes. Twice she caught him at it, and rated him soundly. On one occasion
she even pulled his hair, so that the bystanders burst out laughing. Yet she lost
everything, sir--that is to say, she lost all that you had changed for her. Then
we brought her home, and, after asking for some water and saying her prayers,
she went to bed. So worn out was she that she fell asleep at once. May God
send her dreams of angels! And this is all that foreign travel has done for us!
Oh, my own Moscow! For what have we not at home there, in Moscow? Such a
garden and flowers as you could never see here, and fresh air and apple-trees
coming into blossom,--and a beautiful view to look upon. Ah, but what must
she do but go travelling abroad? Alack, alack!”
XIII
Almost a month has passed since I last touched these notes-- notes which I
began under the influence of impressions at once poignant and disordered. The
crisis which I then felt to be approaching has now arrived, but in a form a
hundred times more extensive and unexpected than I had looked for. To me it
107
all seems strange, uncouth, and tragic. Certain occurrences have befallen me
which border upon the marvellous. At all events, that is how I view them. I
view them so in one regard at least. I refer to the whirlpool of events in which,
at the time, I was revolving. But the most curious feature of all is my relation
to those events, for hitherto I had never clearly understood myself. Yet now the
actual crisis has passed away like a dream. Even my passion for Polina is dead.
Was it ever so strong and genuine as I thought? If so, what has become of it
now? At times I fancy that I must be mad; that somewhere I am sitting in a
madhouse; that these events have merely SEEMED to happen; that still they
merely SEEM to be happening.
I have been arranging and re-perusing my notes (perhaps for the purpose of
convincing myself that I am not in a madhouse). At present I am lonely and
alone. Autumn is coming--already it is mellowing the leaves; and, as I sit
brooding in this melancholy little town (and how melancholy the little towns of
Germany can be!), I find myself taking no thought for the future, but living
under the influence of passing moods, and of my recollections of the tempest
which recently drew me into its vortex, and then cast me out again. At times I
seem still to be caught within that vortex. At times, the tempest seems once
more to be gathering, and, as it passes overhead, to be wrapping me in its
folds, until I have lost my sense of order and reality, and continue whirling and
whirling and whirling around.
Yet, it may be that I shall be able to stop myself from revolving if once I can
succeed in rendering myself an exact account of what has happened within the
month just past. Somehow I feel drawn towards the pen; on many and many
an evening I have had nothing else in the world to do. But, curiously enough, of
late I have taken to amusing myself with the works of M. Paul de Kock, which I
read in German translations obtained from a wretched local library. These
works I cannot abide, yet I read them, and find myself marvelling that I should
be doing so. Somehow I seem to be afraid of any SERIOUS book--afraid of
permitting any SERIOUS preoccupation to break the spell of the passing
moment. So dear to me is the formless dream of which I have spoken, so dear
to me are the impressions which it has left behind it, that I fear to touch the
vision with anything new, lest it should dissolve in smoke. But is it so dear to
108
me? Yes, it IS dear to me, and will ever be fresh in my recollections--even forty
years hence. . . .
So let me write of it, but only partially, and in a more abridged form than my
full impressions might warrant.
First of all, let me conclude the history of the Grandmother. Next day she lost
every gulden that she possessed. Things were bound to happen so, for persons
of her type who have once entered upon that road descend it with
ever-increasing rapidity, even as a sledge descends a toboggan-slide. All day
until eight o’clock that evening did she play; and, though I personally did not
witness her exploits, I learnt of them later through report.
All that day Potapitch remained in attendance upon her; but the Poles who
directed her play she changed more than once. As a beginning she dismissed
her Pole of the previous day--the Pole whose hair she had pulled--and took to
herself another one; but the latter proved worse even than the former, and
incurred dismissal in favour of the first Pole, who, during the time of his
unemployment, had nevertheless hovered around the Grandmother’s chair, and
from time to time obtruded his head over her shoulder. At length the old lady
became desperate, for the second Pole, when dismissed, imitated his
predecessor by declining to go away; with the result that one Pole remained
standing on the right of the victim, and the other on her left; from which
vantage points the pair quarrelled, abused each other concerning the stakes
and rounds, and exchanged the epithet “laidak “ [Rascal] and other Polish
terms of endearment. Finally, they effected a mutual reconciliation, and,
tossing the money about anyhow, played simply at random. Once more
quarrelling, each of them staked money on his own side of the Grandmother’s
chair (for instance, the one Pole staked upon the red, and the other one upon
the black), until they had so confused and browbeaten the old lady that, nearly
weeping, she was forced to appeal to the head croupier for protection, and to
have the two Poles expelled. No time was lost in this being done, despite the
rascals’ cries and protestations that the old lady was in their debt, that she had
cheated them, and that her general behaviour had been mean and
dishonourable. The same evening the unfortunate Potapitch related the story to
109
me with tears complaining that the two men had filled their pockets with
money (he himself had seen them do it) which had been shamelesslly pilfered
from his mistress. For instance, one Pole demanded of the Grandmother fifty
gulden for his trouble, and then staked the money by the side of her stake. She
happened to win; whereupon he cried out that the winning stake was his, and
hers the loser. As soon as the two Poles had been expelled, Potapitch left the
room, and reported to the authorities that the men’s pockets were full of gold;
and, on the Grandmother also requesting the head croupier to look into the
affair, the police made their appearance, and, despite the protests of the Poles
(who, indeed, had been caught redhanded), their pockets were turned inside
out, and the contents handed over to the Grandmother. In fact, in, view of the
circumstance that she lost all day, the croupiers and other authorities of the
Casino showed her every attention; and on her fame spreading through the
town, visitors of every nationality--even the most knowing of them, the most
distinguished--crowded to get a glimpse of “la vieille comtesse russe, tombee
en enfance,” who had lost “so many millions.”
Yet with the money which the authorities restored to her from the pockets of
the Poles the Grandmother effected very, very little, for there soon arrived to
take his countrymen’s place, a third Pole--a man who could speak Russian
fluently, was dressed like a gentleman (albeit in lacqueyish fashion), and
sported a huge moustache. Though polite enough to the old lady, he took a
high hand with the bystanders. In short, he offered himself less as a servant
than as an ENTERTAINER. After each round he would turn to the old lady, and
swear terrible oaths to the effect that he was a “Polish gentleman of honour”
who would scorn to take a kopeck of her money; and, though he repeated
these oaths so often that at length she grew alarmed, he had her play in hand,
and began to win on her behalf; wherefore, she felt that she could not well get
rid of him. An hour later the two Poles who, earlier in the day, had been
expelled from the Casino, made a reappearance behind the old lady’s chair, and
renewed their offers of service--even if it were only to be sent on messages;
but from Potapitch I subsequently had it that between these rascals and the
said “gentleman of honour” there passed a wink, as well as that the latter put
something into their hands. Next, since the Grandmother had not yet
110
lunched--she had scarcely for a moment left her chair--one of the two Poles ran
to the restaurant of the Casino, and brought her thence a cup of soup, and
afterwards some tea. In fact, BOTH the Poles hastened to perform this office.
Finally, towards the close of the day, when it was clear that the Grandmother
was about to play her last bank-note, there could be seen standing behind her
chair no fewer than six natives of Poland--persons who, as yet, had been
neither audible nor visible; and as soon as ever the old lady played the note in
question, they took no further notice of her, but pushed their way past her
chair to the table; seized the money, and staked it--shouting and disputing the
while, and arguing with the “gentleman of honour” (who also had forgotten the
Grandmother’s existence), as though he were their equal. Even when the
Grandmother had lost her all, and was returning (about eight o’clock) to the
hotel, some three or four Poles could not bring themselves to leave her, but
went on running beside her chair and volubly protesting that the Grandmother
had cheated them, and that she ought to be made to surrender what was not
her own. Thus the party arrived at the hotel; whence, presently, the gang of
rascals was ejected neck and crop.
According to Potapitch’s calculations, the Grandmother lost, that day, a total of
ninety thousand roubles, in addition to the money which she had lost the day
before. Every paper security which she had brought with her--five percent
bonds, internal loan scrip, and what not--she had changed into cash. Also, I
could not but marvel at the way in which, for seven or eight hours at a stretch,
she sat in that chair of hers, almost never leaving the table. Again, Potapitch
told me that there were three occasions on which she really began to win; but
that, led on by false hopes, she was unable to tear herself away at the right
moment. Every gambler knows how a person may sit a day and a night at
cards without ever casting a glance to right or to left.
Meanwhile, that day some other very important events were passing in our
hotel. As early as eleven o’clock--that is to say, before the Grandmother had
quitted her rooms--the General and De Griers decided upon their last stroke. In
other words, on learning that the old lady had changed her mind about
departing, and was bent on setting out for the Casino again, the whole of our
gang (Polina only excepted) proceeded en masse to her rooms, for the purpose
111
of finally and frankly treating with her. But the General, quaking and greatly
apprehensive as to his possible future, overdid things. After half an hour’s
prayers and entreaties, coupled with a full confession of his debts, and even of
his passion for Mlle. Blanche (yes, he had quite lost his head), he suddenly
adopted a tone of menace, and started to rage at the old lady--exclaiming that
she was sullying the family honour, that she was making a public scandal of
herself, and that she was smirching the fair name of Russia. The upshot was
that the Grandmother turned him out of the room with her stick (it was a real
stick, too!). Later in the morning he held several consultations with De
Griers--the question which occupied him being: Is it in any way possible to
make use of the police--to tell them that “this respected, but unfortunate, old
lady has gone out of her mind, and is squandering her last kopeck,” or
something of the kind? In short, is it in any way possible to engineer a species
of supervision over, or of restraint upon, the old lady? De Griers, however,
shrugged his shoulders at this, and laughed in the General’s face, while the old
warrior went on chattering volubly, and running up and down his study. Finally
De Griers waved his hand, and disappeared from view; and by evening it
became known that he had left the hotel, after holding a very secret and
important conference with Mlle. Blanche. As for the latter, from early morning
she had taken decisive measures, by completely excluding the General from
her presence, and bestowing upon him not a glance. Indeed, even when the
General pursued her to the Casino, and met her walking arm in arm with the
Prince, he (the General) received from her and her mother not the slightest
recognition. Nor did the Prince himself bow. The rest of the day Mlle. spent in
probing the Prince, and trying to make him declare himself; but in this she
made a woeful mistake. The little incident occurred in the evening. Suddenly
Mlle. Blanche realised that the Prince had not even a copper to his name, but,
on the contrary, was minded to borrow of her money wherewith to play at
roulette. In high displeasure she drove him from her presence, and shut herself
up in her room.
The same morning I went to see--or, rather, to look for--Mr. Astley, but was
unsuccessful in my quest. Neither in his rooms nor in the Casino nor in the Park
was he to be found; nor did he, that day, lunch at his hotel as usual. However,
112
at about five o’clock I caught sight of him walking from the railway station to
the Hotel d’Angleterre. He seemed to be in a great hurry and much
preoccupied, though in his face I could discern no actual traces of worry or
perturbation. He held out to me a friendly hand, with his usual ejaculation of “
Ah! “ but did not check his stride. I turned and walked beside him, but found,
somehow, that his answers forbade any putting of definite questions. Moreover,
I felt reluctant to speak to him of Polina; nor, for his part, did he ask me any
questions concerning her, although, on my telling him of the Grandmother’s
exploits, he listened attentively and gravely, and then shrugged his shoulders.
“She is gambling away everything that she has,” I remarked.
“Indeed? She arrived at the Casino even before I had taken my departure by
train, so I knew she had been playing. If I should have time I will go to the
Casino to-night, and take a look at her. The thing interests me.”
“Where have you been today?” I asked--surprised at myself for having, as yet,
omitted to put to him that question.
“To Frankfort.”
“On business?”
“On business.”
What more was there to be asked after that? I accompanied him until, as we
drew level with the Hotel des Quatre Saisons, he suddenly nodded to me and
disappeared. For myself, I returned home, and came to the conclusion that,
even had I met him at two o’clock in the afternoon, I should have learnt no
more from him than I had done at five o’clock, for the reason that I had no
definite question to ask. It was bound to have been so. For me to formulate the
query which I really wished to put was a simple impossibility.
Polina spent the whole of that day either in walking about the park with the
nurse and children or in sitting in her own room. For a long while past she had
avoided the General and had scarcely had a word to say to him (scarcely a
word, I mean, on any SERIOUS topic). Yes, that I had noticed. Still, even
though I was aware of the position in which the General was placed, it had
113
never occurred to me that he would have any reason to avoid HER, or to
trouble her with family explanations. Indeed, when I was returning to the hotel
after my conversation with Astley, and chanced to meet Polina and the
children, I could see that her face was as calm as though the family
disturbances had never touched her. To my salute she responded with a slight
bow, and I retired to my room in a very bad humour.
Of course, since the affair with the Burmergelms I had exchanged not a word
with Polina, nor had with her any kind of intercourse. Yet I had been at my
wits’ end, for, as time went on, there was arising in me an ever-seething
dissatisfaction. Even if she did not love me she ought not to have trampled
upon my feelings, nor to have accepted my confessions with such contempt,
seeing that she must have been aware that I loved her (of her own accord she
had allowed me to tell her as much). Of course the situation between us had
arisen in a curious manner. About two months ago, I had noticed that she had
a desire to make me her friend, her confidant--that she was making trial of me
for the purpose; but, for some reason or another, the desired result had never
come about, and we had fallen into the present strange relations, which had led
me to address her as I had done. At the same time, if my love was distasteful
to her, why had she not FORBIDDEN me to speak of it to her?
But she had not so forbidden me. On the contrary, there had been occasions
when she had even INVITED me to speak. Of course, this might have been
done out of sheer wantonness, for I well knew--I had remarked it only too
often--that, after listening to what I had to say, and angering me almost
beyond endurance, she loved suddenly to torture me with some fresh outburst
of contempt and aloofness! Yet she must have known that I could not live
without her. Three days had elapsed since the affair with the Baron, and I could
bear the severance no longer. When, that afternoon, I met her near the Casino,
my heart almost made me faint, it beat so violently. She too could not live
without me, for had she not said that she had NEED of me? Or had that too
been spoken in jest?
That she had a secret of some kind there could be no doubt. What she had said
to the Grandmother had stabbed me to the heart. On a thousand occasions I
114
had challenged her to be open with me, nor could she have been ignorant that
I was ready to give my very life for her. Yet always she had kept me at a
distance with that contemptuous air of hers; or else she had demanded of me,
in lieu of the life which I offered to lay at her feet, such escapades as I had
perpetrated with the Baron. Ah, was it not torture to me, all this? For could it
be that her whole world was bound up with the Frenchman? What, too, about
Mr. Astley? The affair was inexplicable throughout. My God, what distress it
caused me!
Arrived home, I, in a fit of frenzy, indited the following:
“Polina Alexandrovna, I can see that there is approaching us an exposure which
will involve you too. For the last time I ask of you--have you, or have you not,
any need of my life? If you have, then make such dispositions as you wish, and
I shall always be discoverable in my room if required. If you have need of my
life, write or send for me.”
I sealed the letter, and dispatched it by the hand of a corridor lacquey, with
orders to hand it to the addressee in person. Though I expected no answer,
scarcely three minutes had elapsed before the lacquey returned with “the
compliments of a certain person.”
Next, about seven o’clock, I was sent for by the General. I found him in his
study, apparently preparing to go out again, for his hat and stick were lying on
the sofa. When I entered he was standing in the middle of the room--his feet
wide apart, and his head bent down. Also, he appeared to be talking to himself.
But as soon as ever he saw me at the door he came towards me in such a
curious manner that involuntarily I retreated a step, and was for leaving the
room; whereupon he seized me by both hands, and, drawing me towards the
sofa, and seating himself thereon, he forced me to sit down on a chair opposite
him. Then, without letting go of my hands, he exclaimed with quivering lips and
a sparkle of tears on his eyelashes:
“Oh, Alexis Ivanovitch! Save me, save me! Have some mercy upon me!”
For a long time I could not make out what he meant, although he kept talking
and talking, and constantly repeating to himself, “Have mercy, mercy!” At
115
length, however, I divined that he was expecting me to give him something in
the nature of advice--or, rather, that, deserted by every one, and overwhelmed
with grief and apprehension, he had bethought himself of my existence, and
sent for me to relieve his feelings by talking and talking and talking.
In fact, he was in such a confused and despondent state of mind that, clasping
his hands together, he actually went down upon his knees and begged me to
go to Mlle. Blanche, and beseech and advise her to return to him, and to accept
him in marriage.
“But, General,” I exclaimed, “possibly Mlle. Blanche has scarcely even remarked
my existence? What could I do with her?”
It was in vain that I protested, for he could understand nothing that was said to
him, Next he started talking about the Grandmother, but always in a
disconnected sort of fashion--his one thought being to send for the police.
“In Russia,” said he, suddenly boiling over with indignation, “or in any
well-ordered State where there exists a government, old women like my
mother are placed under proper guardianship. Yes, my good sir,” he went on,
relapsing into a scolding tone as he leapt to his feet and started to pace the
room, “do you not know this “ (he seemed to be addressing some imaginary
auditor in the corner) “--do you not know this, that in Russia old women like
her are subjected to restraint, the devil take them?” Again he threw himself
down upon the sofa.
A minute later, though sobbing and almost breathless, he managed to gasp out
that Mlle. Blanche had refused to marry him, for the reason that the
Grandmother had turned up in place of a telegram, and it was therefore clear
that he had no inheritance to look for. Evidently, he supposed that I had
hitherto been in entire ignorance of all this. Again, when I referred to De Griers,
the General made a gesture of despair. “He has gone away,” he said, “and
everything which I possess is mortgaged to him. I stand stripped to my skin.
Even of the money which you brought me from Paris, I know not if seven
hundred francs be left. Of course that sum will do to go on with, but, as regards
the future, I know nothing, I know nothing.”
116
“Then how will you pay your hotel bill?” I cried in consternation. “And what
shall you do afterwards?”
He looked at me vaguely, but it was clear that he had not understood--perhaps
had not even heard--my questions. Then I tried to get him to speak of Polina
and the children, but he only returned brief answers of “ Yes, yes,” and again
started to maunder about the Prince, and the likelihood of the latter marrying
Mlle. Blanche. “What on earth am I to do?” he concluded. “What on earth am I
to do? Is this not ingratitude? Is it not sheer ingratitude?” And he burst into
tears.
Nothing could be done with such a man. Yet to leave him alone was dangerous,
for something might happen to him. I withdrew from his rooms for a little
while, but warned the nursemaid to keep an eye upon him, as well as
exchanged a word with the corridor lacquey (a very talkative fellow), who
likewise promised to remain on the look-out.
Hardly had I left the General, when Potapitch approached me with a summons
from the Grandmother. It was now eight o’clock, and she had returned from
the Casino after finally losing all that she possessed. I found her sitting in her
chair--much distressed and evidently fatigued. Presently Martha brought her up
a cup of tea and forced her to drink it; yet, even then I could detect in the old
lady’s tone and manner a great change.
“Good evening, Alexis Ivanovitch,” she said slowly, with her head drooping.
“Pardon me for disturbing you again. Yes, you must pardon an old, old woman
like myself, for I have left behind me all that I possess--nearly a hundred
thousand roubles! You did quite right in declining to come with me this evening.
Now I am without money--without a single groat. But I must not delay a
moment; I must leave by the 9:30 train. I have sent for that English friend of
yours, and am going to beg of him three thousand francs for a week. Please try
and persuade him to think nothing of it, nor yet to refuse me, for I am still a
rich woman who possesses three villages and a couple of mansions. Yes, the
money shall be found, for I have not yet squandered EVERYTHING. I tell you
this in order that he may have no doubts about--Ah, but here he is! Clearly he
is a good fellow.”
117
True enough, Astley had come hot-foot on receiving the Grandmother’s appeal.
Scarcely stopping even to reflect, and with scarcely a word, he counted out the
three thousand francs under a note of hand which she duly signed. Then, his
business done, he bowed, and lost no time in taking his departure.
“You too leave me, Alexis Ivanovitch,” said the Grandmother. “All my bones are
aching, and I still have an hour in which to rest. Do not be hard upon me, old
fool that I am. Never again shall I blame young people for being frivolous. I
should think it wrong even to blame that unhappy General of yours.
Nevertheless, I do not mean to let him have any of my money (which is all that
he desires), for the reason that I look upon him as a perfect blockhead, and
consider myself, simpleton though I be, at least wiser than HE is. How surely
does God visit old age, and punish it for its presumption! Well, good-bye.
Martha, come and lift me up.”
However, I had a mind to see the old lady off; and, moreover, I was in an
expectant frame of mind--somehow I kept thinking that SOMETHING was going
to happen; wherefore, I could not rest quietly in my room, but stepped out into
the corridor, and then into the Chestnut Avenue for a few minutes’ stroll. My
letter to Polina had been clear and firm, and in the present crisis, I felt sure,
would prove final. I had heard of De Griers’ departure, and, however much
Polina might reject me as a FRIEND, she might not reject me altogether as a
SERVANT. She would need me to fetch and carry for her, and I was ready to do
so. How could it have been otherwise?
Towards the hour of the train’s departure I hastened to the station, and put the
Grandmother into her compartment--she and her party occupying a reserved
family saloon.
“Thanks for your disinterested assistance,” she said at parting. “Oh, and please
remind Prascovia of what I said to her last night. I expect soon to see her.”
Then I returned home. As I was passing the door of the General’s suite, I met
the nursemaid, and inquired after her master. “There is nothing new to report,
sir,” she replied quietly. Nevertheless I decided to enter, and was just doing so
when I halted thunderstruck on the threshold. For before me I beheld the
118
General and Mlle. Blanche--laughing gaily at one another!-- while beside them,
on the sofa, there was seated her mother. Clearly the General was almost out
of his mind with joy, for he was talking all sorts of nonsense, and bubbling over
with a long-drawn, nervous laugh--a laugh which twisted his face into
innumerable wrinkles, and caused his eyes almost to disappear.
Afterwards I learnt from Mlle. Blanche herself that, after dismissing the Prince
and hearing of the General’s tears, she bethought her of going to comfort the
old man, and had just arrived for the purpose when I entered. Fortunately, the
poor General did not know that his fate had been decided--that Mlle. had long
ago packed her trunks in readiness for the first morning train to Paris!
Hesitating a moment on the threshold I changed my mind as to entering, and
departed unnoticed. Ascending to my own room, and opening the door, I
perceived in the semi-darkness a figure seated on a chair in the corner by the
window. The figure did not rise when I entered, so I approached it swiftly,
peered at it closely, and felt my heart almost stop beating. The figure was
Polina!
XIV
The shock made me utter an exclamation.
“What is the matter? What is the matter?” she asked in a strange voice. She
was looking pale, and her eyes were dim.
“What is the matter?” I re-echoed. “Why, the fact that you are HERE!”
“If I am here, I have come with all that I have to bring,” she said. “Such has
always been my way, as you shall presently see. Please light a candle.”
I did so; whereupon she rose, approached the table, and laid upon it an open
letter.
“Read it,” she added.
“It is De Griers’ handwriting!” I cried as I seized the document. My hands were
so tremulous that the lines on the pages danced before my eyes. Although, at
119
this distance of time, I have forgotten the exact phraseology of the missive, I
append, if not the precise words, at all events the general sense.
“Mademoiselle,” the document ran, “certain untoward circumstances compel me
to depart in haste. Of course, you have of yourself remarked that hitherto I
have always refrained from having any final explanation with you, for the
reason that I could not well state the whole circumstances; and now to my
difficulties the advent of the aged Grandmother, coupled with her subsequent
proceedings, has put the final touch. Also, the involved state of my affairs
forbids me to write with any finality concerning those hopes of ultimate bliss
upon which, for a long while past, I have permitted myself to feed. I regret the
past, but at the same time hope that in my conduct you have never been able
to detect anything that was unworthy of a gentleman and a man of honour.
Having lost, however, almost the whole of my money in debts incurred by your
stepfather, I find myself driven to the necessity of saving the remainder;
wherefore, I have instructed certain friends of mine in St. Petersburg to
arrange for the sale of all the property which has been mortgaged to myself. At
the same time, knowing that, in addition, your frivolous stepfather has
squandered money which is exclusively yours, I have decided to absolve him
from a certain moiety of the mortgages on his property, in order that you may
be in a position to recover of him what you have lost, by suing him in legal
fashion. I trust, therefore, that, as matters now stand, this action of mine may
bring you some advantage. I trust also that this same action leaves me in the
position of having fulfilled every obligation which is incumbent upon a man of
honour and refinement. Rest assured that your memory will for ever remain
graven in my heart.”
“All this is clear enough,” I commented. “Surely you did not expect aught else
from him?” Somehow I was feeling annoyed.
“I expected nothing at all from him,” she replied--quietly enough, to all
outward seeming, yet with a note of irritation in her tone. “Long ago I made up
my mind on the subject, for I could read his thoughts, and knew what he was
thinking. He thought that possibly I should sue him--that one day I might
become a nuisance.” Here Polina halted for a moment, and stood biting her
120
lips. “So of set purpose I redoubled my contemptuous treatment of him, and
waited to see what he would do. If a telegram to say that we had become
legatees had arrived from, St. Petersburg, I should have flung at him a
quittance for my foolish stepfather’s debts, and then dismissed him. For a long
time I have hated him. Even in earlier days he was not a man; and now!--Oh,
how gladly I could throw those fifty thousand roubles in his face, and spit in it,
and then rub the spittle in!”
“But the document returning the fifty-thousand rouble mortgage--has the
General got it? If so, possess yourself of it, and send it to De Griers.”
“No, no; the General has not got it.”
“Just as I expected! Well, what is the General going to do?” Then an idea
suddenly occurred to me. “What about the Grandmother?” I asked.
Polina looked at me with impatience and bewilderment.
“What makes you speak of HER?” was her irritable inquiry. “I cannot go and
live with her. Nor,” she added hotly, “will I go down upon my knees to ANY
ONE.”
“Why should you?” I cried. “Yet to think that you should have loved De Griers!
The villain, the villain! But I will kill him in a duel. Where is he now?”
“In Frankfort, where he will be staying for the next three days.”
“Well, bid me do so, and I will go to him by the first train tomorrow,” I
exclaimed with enthusiasm.
She smiled.
“If you were to do that,” she said, “he would merely tell you to be so good as
first to return him the fifty thousand francs. What, then, would be the use of
having a quarrel with him? You talk sheer nonsense.”
I ground my teeth.
“The question,” I went on, “is how to raise the fifty thousand francs. We cannot
expect to find them lying about on the floor. Listen. What of Mr. Astley?” Even
121
as I spoke a new and strange idea formed itself in my brain.
Her eyes flashed fire.
“What? YOU YOURSELF wish me to leave you for him?” she cried with a scornful
look and a proud smile. Never before had she addressed me thus.
Then her head must have turned dizzy with emotion, for suddenly she seated
herself upon the sofa, as though she were powerless any longer to stand.
A flash of lightning seemed to strike me as I stood there. I could scarcely
believe my eyes or my ears. She DID love me, then! It WAS to me, and not to
Mr. Astley, that she had turned! Although she, an unprotected girl, had come to
me in my room--in an hotel room--and had probably compromised herself
thereby, I had not understood!
Then a second mad idea flashed into my brain.
“Polina,” I said, “give me but an hour. Wait here just one hour until I return.
Yes, you MUST do so. Do you not see what I mean? Just stay here for that
time.”
And I rushed from the room without so much as answering her look of inquiry.
She called something after me, but I did not return.
Sometimes it happens that the most insane thought, the most impossible
conception, will become so fixed in one’s head that at length one believes the
thought or the conception to be reality. Moreover, if with the thought or the
conception there is combined a strong, a passionate, desire, one will come to
look upon the said thought or conception as something fated, inevitable, and
foreordained--something bound to happen. Whether by this there is connoted
something in the nature of a combination of presentiments, or a great effort of
will, or a self-annulment of one’s true expectations, and so on, I do not know;
but, at all events that night saw happen to me (a night which I shall never
forget) something in the nature of the miraculous. Although the occurrence can
easily be explained by arithmetic, I still believe it to have been a miracle. Yet
why did this conviction take such a hold upon me at the time, and remain with
me ever since? Previously, I had thought of the idea, not as an occurrence
122
which was ever likely to come about, but as something which NEVER could
come about.
The time was a quarter past eleven o’clock when I entered the Casino in such a
state of hope (though, at the same time, of agitation) as I had never before
experienced. In the gaming-rooms there were still a large number of people,
but not half as many as had been present in the morning.
At eleven o’clock there usually remained behind only the real, the desperate
gamblers--persons for whom, at spas, there existed nothing beyond roulette,
and who went thither for that alone. These gamesters took little note of what
was going on around them, and were interested in none of the appurtenances
of the season, but played from morning till night, and would have been ready
to play through the night until dawn had that been possible. As it was, they
used to disperse unwillingly when, at midnight, roulette came to an end.
Likewise, as soon as ever roulette was drawing to a close and the head croupier
had called “Les trois derniers coups,” most of them were ready to stake on the
last three rounds all that they had in their pockets--and, for the most part, lost
it. For my own part I proceeded towards the table at which the Grandmother
had lately sat; and, since the crowd around it was not very large, I soon
obtained standing room among the ring of gamblers, while directly in front of
me, on the green cloth, I saw marked the word “Passe.”
“Passe” was a row of numbers from 19 to 36 inclusive; while a row of numbers
from 1 to 18 inclusive was known as “Manque.” But what had that to do with
me? I had not noticed--I had not so much as heard the numbers upon which
the previous coup had fallen, and so took no bearings when I began to play, as,
in my place, any SYSTEMATIC gambler would have done. No, I merely
extended my stock of twenty ten-gulden pieces, and threw them down upon
the space “Passe” which happened to be confronting me.
“Vingt-deux!” called the croupier.
I had won! I staked upon the same again--both my original stake and my
winnings.
“Trente-et-un!” called the croupier.
123
Again I had won, and was now in possession of eighty ten-gulden pieces. Next,
I moved the whole eighty on to twelve middle numbers (a stake which, if
successful, would bring me in a triple profit, but also involved a risk of two
chances to one). The wheel revolved, and stopped at twenty-four. Upon this I
was paid out notes and gold until I had by my side a total sum of two thousand
gulden.
It was as in a fever that I moved the pile, en bloc, on to the red. Then suddenly
I came to myself (though that was the only time during the evening’s play
when fear cast its cold spell over me, and showed itself in a trembling of the
hands and knees). For with horror I had realised that I MUST win, and that
upon that stake there depended all my life.
“Rouge!” called the croupier. I drew a long breath, and hot shivers went
coursing over my body. I was paid out my winnings in bank-notes--amounting,
of course, to a total of four thousand florins, eight hundred gulden (I could still
calculate the amounts).
After that, I remember, I again staked two thousand florins upon twelve middle
numbers, and lost. Again I staked the whole of my gold, with eight hundred
gulden, in notes, and lost. Then madness seemed to come upon me, and
seizing my last two thousand florins, I staked them upon twelve of the first
numbers--wholly by chance, and at random, and without any sort of reckoning.
Upon my doing so there followed a moment of suspense only comparable to
that which Madame Blanchard must have experienced when, in Paris, she was
descending earthwards from a balloon.
“Quatre!” called the croupier.
Once more, with the addition of my original stake, I was in possession of six
thousand florins! Once more I looked around me like a conqueror--once more I
feared nothing as I threw down four thousand of these florins upon the black.
The croupiers glanced around them, and exchanged a few words; the
bystanders murmured expectantly.
The black turned up. After that I do not exactly remember either my
calculations or the order of my stakings. I only remember that, as in a dream, I
124
won in one round sixteen thousand florins; that in the three following rounds, I
lost twelve thousand; that I moved the remainder (four thousand) on to
“Passe” (though quite unconscious of what I was doing--I was merely waiting,
as it were, mechanically, and without reflection, for something) and won; and
that, finally, four times in succession I lost. Yes, I can remember raking in
money by thousands--but most frequently on the twelve, middle numbers, to
which I constantly adhered, and which kept appearing in a sort of regular
order--first, three or four times running, and then, after an interval of a couple
of rounds, in another break of three or four appearances. Sometimes, this
astonishing regularity manifested itself in patches; a thing to upset all the
calculations of note--taking gamblers who play with a pencil and a
memorandum book in their hands Fortune perpetrates some terrible jests at
roulette!
Since my entry not more than half an hour could have elapsed. Suddenly a
croupier informed me that I had, won thirty thousand florins, as well as that,
since the latter was the limit for which, at any one time, the bank could make
itself responsible, roulette at that table must close for the night. Accordingly, I
caught up my pile of gold, stuffed it into my pocket, and, grasping my sheaf of
bank-notes, moved to the table in an adjoining salon where a second game of
roulette was in progress. The crowd followed me in a body, and cleared a place
for me at the table; after which, I proceeded to stake as before--that is to say,
at random and without calculating. What saved me from ruin I do not know.
Of course there were times when fragmentary reckonings DID come flashing
into my brain. For instance, there were times when I attached myself for a
while to certain figures and coups--though always leaving them, again before
long, without knowing what I was doing.
In fact, I cannot have been in possession of all my faculties, for I can
remember the croupiers correcting my play more than once, owing to my
having made mistakes of the gravest order. My brows were damp with sweat,
and my hands were shaking. Also, Poles came around me to proffer their
services, but I heeded none of them. Nor did my luck fail me now. Suddenly,
there arose around me a loud din of talking and laughter. “ Bravo, bravo! “ was
125
the general shout, and some people even clapped their hands. I had raked in
thirty thousand florins, and again the bank had had to close for the night!
“Go away now, go away now,” a voice whispered to me on my right. The
person who had spoken to me was a certain Jew of Frankfurt--a man who had
been standing beside me the whole while, and occasionally helping me in my
play.
“Yes, for God’s sake go,” whispered a second voice in my left ear. Glancing
around, I perceived that the second voice had come from a modestly, plainly
dressed lady of rather less than thirty--a woman whose face, though pale and
sickly-looking, bore also very evident traces of former beauty. At the moment,
I was stuffing the crumpled bank-notes into my pockets and collecting all the
gold that was left on the table. Seizing up my last note for five hundred gulden,
I contrived to insinuate it, unperceived, into the hand of the pale lady. An
overpowering impulse had made me do so, and I remember how her thin little
fingers pressed mine in token of her lively gratitude. The whole affair was the
work of a moment.
Then, collecting my belongings, I crossed to where trente et quarante was
being played--a game which could boast of a more aristocratic public, and was
played with cards instead of with a wheel. At this diversion the bank made itself
responsible for a hundred thousand thalers as the limit, but the highest stake
allowable was, as in roulette, four thousand florins. Although I knew nothing of
the game--and I scarcely knew the stakes, except those on black and red--I
joined the ring of players, while the rest of the crowd massed itself around me.
At this distance of time I cannot remember whether I ever gave a thought to
Polina; I seemed only to be conscious of a vague pleasure in seizing and raking
in the bank-notes which kept massing themselves in a pile before me.
But, as ever, fortune seemed to be at my back. As though of set purpose, there
came to my aid a circumstance which not infrequently repeats itself in gaming.
The circumstance is that not infrequently luck attaches itself to, say, the red,
and does not leave it for a space of say, ten, or even fifteen, rounds in
succession. Three days ago I had heard that, during the previous week there
had been a run of twenty-two coups on the red--an occurrence never before
126
known at roulette--so that men spoke of it with astonishment. Naturally
enough, many deserted the red after a dozen rounds, and practically no one
could now be found to stake upon it. Yet upon the black also--the antithesis of
the red--no experienced gambler would stake anything, for the reason that
every practised player knows the meaning of “capricious fortune.” That is to
say, after the sixteenth (or so) success of the red, one would think that the
seventeenth coup would inevitably fall upon the black; wherefore, novices
would be apt to back the latter in the seventeenth round, and even to double or
treble their stakes upon it--only, in the end, to lose.
Yet some whim or other led me, on remarking that the red had come up
consecutively for seven times, to attach myself to that colour. Probably this
was mostly due to self-conceit, for I wanted to astonish the bystanders with the
riskiness of my play. Also, I remember that--oh, strange sensation!--I
suddenly, and without any challenge from my own presumption, became
obsessed with a DESIRE to take risks. If the spirit has passed through a great
many sensations, possibly it can no longer be sated with them, but grows more
excited, and demands more sensations, and stronger and stronger ones, until
at length it falls exhausted. Certainly, if the rules of the game had permitted
even of my staking fifty thousand florins at a time, I should have staked them.
All of a sudden I heard exclamations arising that the whole thing was a marvel,
since the red was turning up for the fourteenth time!
“Monsieur a gagne cent mille florins,” a voice exclaimed beside me.
I awoke to my senses. What? I had won a hundred thousand florins? If so,
what more did I need to win? I grasped the banknotes, stuffed them into my
pockets, raked in the gold without counting it, and started to leave the Casino.
As I passed through the salons people smiled to see my bulging pockets and
unsteady gait, for the weight which I was carrying must have amounted to half
a pood! Several hands I saw stretched out in my direction, and as I passed I
filled them with all the money that I could grasp in my own. At length two Jews
stopped me near the exit.
“You are a bold young fellow,” one said, “but mind you depart early
tomorrow--as early as you can--for if you do not you will lose everything that
127
you have won.”
But I did not heed them. The Avenue was so dark that it was barely possible to
distinguish one’s hand before one’s face, while the distance to the hotel was
half a verst or so; but I feared neither pickpockets nor highwaymen. Indeed,
never since my boyhood have I done that. Also, I cannot remember what I
thought about on the way. I only felt a sort of fearful pleasure --the pleasure of
success, of conquest, of power (how can I best express it?). Likewise, before
me there flitted the image of Polina; and I kept remembering, and reminding
myself, that it was to HER I was going, that it was in HER presence I should
soon be standing, that it was SHE to whom I should soon be able to relate and
show everything. Scarcely once did I recall what she had lately said to me, or
the reason why I had left her, or all those varied sensations which I had been
experiencing a bare hour and a half ago. No, those sensations seemed to be
things of the past, to be things which had righted themselves and grown old, to
be things concerning which we needed to trouble ourselves no longer, since, for
us, life was about to begin anew. Yet I had just reached the end of the Avenue
when there DID come upon me a fear of being robbed or murdered. With each
step the fear increased until, in my terror, I almost started to run. Suddenly, as
I issued from the Avenue, there burst upon me the lights of the hotel, sparkling
with a myriad lamps! Yes, thanks be to God, I had reached home!
Running up to my room, I flung open the door of it. Polina was still on the sofa,
with a lighted candle in front of her, and her hands clasped. As I entered she
stared at me in astonishment (for, at the moment, I must have presented a
strange spectacle). All I did, however, was to halt before her, and fling upon
the table my burden of wealth.
XV
I remember, too, how, without moving from her place, or changing her
attitude, she gazed into my face.
“I have won two hundred thousand francs!” cried I as I pulled out my last sheaf
of bank-notes. The pile of paper currency occupied the whole table. I could not
withdraw my eyes from it. Consequently, for a moment or two Polina escaped
128
my mind. Then I set myself to arrange the pile in order, and to sort the notes,
and to mass the gold in a separate heap. That done, I left everything where it
lay, and proceeded to pace the room with rapid strides as I lost myself in
thought. Then I darted to the table once more, and began to recount the
money; until all of a sudden, as though I had remembered something, I rushed
to the door, and closed and double-locked it. Finally I came to a meditative halt
before my little trunk.
“Shall I put the money there until tomorrow?” I asked, turning sharply round to
Polina as the recollection of her returned to me.
She was still in her old place--still making not a sound. Yet her eyes had
followed every one of my movements. Somehow in her face there was a
strange expression--an expression which I did not like. I think that I shall not
be wrong if I say that it indicated sheer hatred.
Impulsively I approached her.
“Polina,” I said, “here are twenty-five thousand florins--fifty thousand francs, or
more. Take them, and tomorrow throw them in De Griers’ face.”
She returned no answer.
“Or, if you should prefer,” I continued, “let me take them to him myself
tomorrow--yes, early tomorrow morning. Shall I?”
Then all at once she burst out laughing, and laughed for a long while. With
astonishment and a feeling of offence I gazed at her. Her laughter was too like
the derisive merriment which she had so often indulged in of late--merriment
which had broken forth always at the time of my most passionate explanations.
At length she ceased, and frowned at me from under her eyebrows.
“I am NOT going to take your money,” she said contemptuously.
“Why not?” I cried. “Why not, Polina?”
“Because I am not in the habit of receiving money for nothing.”
“But I am offering it to you as a FRIEND in the same way I would offer you my
129
very life.”
Upon this she threw me a long, questioning glance, as though she were seeking
to probe me to the depths.
“You are giving too much for me,” she remarked with a smile. “The beloved of
De Griers is not worth fifty thousand francs.”
“Oh Polina, how can you speak so?” I exclaimed reproachfully. “Am I De
Griers?”
“You?” she cried with her eyes suddenly flashing. “Why, I HATE you! Yes, yes, I
HATE you! I love you no more than I do De Griers.”
Then she buried her face in her hands, and relapsed into hysterics. I darted to
her side. Somehow I had an intuition of something having happened to her
which had nothing to do with myself. She was like a person temporarily insane.
“Buy me, would you, would you? Would you buy me for fifty thousand francs as
De Griers did?” she gasped between her convulsive sobs.
I clasped her in my arms, kissed her hands and feet, and fell upon my knees
before her.
Presently the hysterical fit passed away, and, laying her hands upon my
shoulders, she gazed for a while into my face, as though trying to read
it--something I said to her, but it was clear that she did not hear it. Her face
looked so dark and despondent that I began to fear for her reason. At length
she drew me towards herself--a trustful smile playing over her features; and
then, as suddenly, she pushed me away again as she eyed me dimly.
Finally she threw herself upon me in an embrace.
“You love me?” she said. “DO you?--you who were willing even to quarrel with
the Baron at my bidding?”
Then she laughed--laughed as though something dear, but laughable, had
recurred to her memory. Yes, she laughed and wept at the same time. What
was I to do? I was like a man in a fever. I remember that she began to say
130
something to me--though WHAT I do not know, since she spoke with a feverish
lisp, as though she were trying to tell me something very quickly. At intervals,
too, she would break off into the smile which I was beginning to dread. “No,
no!” she kept repeating. “YOU are my dear one; YOU are the man I trust.”
Again she laid her hands upon my shoulders, and again she gazed at me as she
reiterated: “You love me, you love me? Will you ALWAYS love me?” I could not
take my eyes off her. Never before had I seen her in this mood of humility and
affection. True, the mood was the outcome of hysteria; but--! All of a sudden
she noticed my ardent gaze, and smiled slightly. The next moment, for no
apparent reason, she began to talk of Astley.
She continued talking and talking about him, but I could not make out all she
said--more particularly when she was endeavouring to tell me of something or
other which had happened recently. On the whole, she appeared to be laughing
at Astley, for she kept repeating that he was waiting for her, and did I know
whether, even at that moment, he was not standing beneath the window? “Yes,
yes, he is there,” she said. “Open the window, and see if he is not.” She pushed
me in that direction; yet, no sooner did I make a movement to obey her behest
than she burst into laughter, and I remained beside her, and she embraced me.
“Shall we go away tomorrow?” presently she asked, as though some disturbing
thought had recurred to her recollection. “How would it be if we were to try and
overtake Grandmamma? I think we should do so at Berlin. And what think you
she would have to say to us when we caught her up, and her eyes first lit upon
us? What, too, about Mr. Astley? HE would not leap from the Shlangenberg for
my sake! No! Of that I am very sure!”--and she laughed. “Do you know where
he is going next year? He says he intends to go to the North Pole for scientific
investigations, and has invited me to go with him! Ha, ha, ha! He also says that
we Russians know nothing, can do nothing, without European help. But he is a
good fellow all the same. For instance, he does not blame the General in the
matter, but declares that Mlle. Blanche--that love--But no; I do not know, I do
not know.” She stopped suddenly, as though she had said her say, and was
feeling bewildered. “What poor creatures these people are. How sorry I am for
them, and for Grandmamma! But when are you going to kill De Griers? Surely
you do not intend actually to murder him? You fool! Do you suppose that I
131
should ALLOW you to fight De Griers? Nor shall you kill the Baron.” Here she
burst out laughing. “How absurd you looked when you were talking to the
Burmergelms! I was watching you all the time--watching you from where I was
sitting. And how unwilling you were to go when I sent you! Oh, how I laughed
and laughed!”
Then she kissed and embraced me again; again she pressed her face to mine
with tender passion. Yet I neither saw nor heard her, for my head was in a
whirl. . . .
It must have been about seven o’clock in the morning when I awoke. Daylight
had come, and Polina was sitting by my side--a strange expression on her face,
as though she had seen a vision and was unable to collect her thoughts. She
too had just awoken, and was now staring at the money on the table. My head
ached; it felt heavy. I attempted to take Polina’s hand, but she pushed me from
her, and leapt from the sofa. The dawn was full of mist, for rain had fallen, yet
she moved to the window, opened it, and, leaning her elbows upon the
window-sill, thrust out her head and shoulders to take the air. In this position
did she remain for several minutes, without ever looking round at me, or
listening to what I was saying. Into my head there came the uneasy thought:
What is to happen now? How is it all to end? Suddenly Polina rose from the
window, approached the table, and, looking at me with an expression of infinite
aversion, said with lips which quivered with anger:
“Well? Are you going to hand me over my fifty thousand francs?”
“Polina, you say that AGAIN, AGAIN?” I exclaimed.
“You have changed your mind, then? Ha, ha, ha! You are sorry you ever
promised them?”
On the table where, the previous night, I had counted the money there still was
lying the packet of twenty five thousand florins. I handed it to her.
“The francs are mine, then, are they? They are mine?” she inquired viciously as
she balanced the money in her hands.
“Yes; they have ALWAYS been yours,” I said.
132
“Then TAKE your fifty thousand francs!” and she hurled them full in my face.
The packet burst as she did so, and the floor became strewed with bank-notes.
The instant that the deed was done she rushed from the room.
At that moment she cannot have been in her right mind; yet, what was the
cause of her temporary aberration I cannot say. For a month past she had been
unwell. Yet what had brought about this PRESENT condition of mind,above all
things, this outburst? Had it come of wounded pride? Had it come of despair
over her decision to come to me? Had it come of the fact that, presuming too
much on my good fortune, I had seemed to be intending to desert her (even as
De Griers had done) when once I had given her the fifty thousand francs? But,
on my honour, I had never cherished any such intention. What was at fault, I
think, was her own pride, which kept urging her not to trust me, but, rather, to
insult me--even though she had not realised the fact. In her eyes I
corresponded to De Griers, and therefore had been condemned for a fault not
wholly my own. Her mood of late had been a sort of delirium, a sort of
light-headedness--that I knew full well; yet, never had I sufficiently taken it
into consideration. Perhaps she would not pardon me now? Ah, but this was
THE PRESENT. What about the future? Her delirium and sickness were not likely
to make her forget what she had done in bringing me De Griers’ letter. No, she
must have known what she was doing when she brought it.
Somehow I contrived to stuff the pile of notes and gold under the bed, to cover
them over, and then to leave the room some ten minutes after Polina. I felt
sure that she had returned to her own room; wherefore, I intended quietly to
follow her, and to ask the nursemaid aid who opened the door how her mistress
was. Judge, therefore, of my surprise when, meeting the domestic on the
stairs, she informed me that Polina had not yet returned, and that she (the
domestic) was at that moment on her way to my room in quest of her!
“Mlle. left me but ten minutes ago,” I said. “What can have become of her?”
The nursemaid looked at me reproachfully.
Already sundry rumours were flying about the hotel. Both in the office of the
commissionaire and in that of the landlord it was whispered that, at seven
o’clock that morning, the Fraulein had left the hotel, and set off, despite the
133
rain, in the direction of the Hotel d’Angleterre. From words and hints let fall I
could see that the fact of Polina having spent the night in my room was now
public property. Also, sundry rumours were circulating concerning the General’s
family affairs. It was known that last night he had gone out of his mind, and
paraded the hotel in tears; also, that the old lady who had arrived was his
mother, and that she had come from Russia on purpose to forbid her son’s
marriage with Mlle. de Cominges, as well as to cut him out of her will if he
should disobey her; also that, because he had disobeyed her, she had
squandered all her money at roulette, in order to have nothing more to leave to
him. “Oh, these Russians!” exclaimed the landlord, with an angry toss of the
head, while the bystanders laughed and the clerk betook himself to his
accounts. Also, every one had learnt about my winnings; Karl, the corridor
lacquey, was the first to congratulate me. But with these folk I had nothing to
do. My business was to set off at full speed to the Hotel d’Angleterre.
As yet it was early for Mr. Astley to receive visitors; but, as soon as he learnt
that it was I who had arrived, he came out into the corridor to meet me, and
stood looking at me in silence with his steel-grey eyes as he waited to hear
what I had to say. I inquired after Polina.
“She is ill,” he replied, still looking at me with his direct, unwavering glance.
“And she is in your rooms.”
“Yes, she is in my rooms.”
“Then you are minded to keep her there?”
“Yes, I am minded to keep her there.”
“But, Mr. Astley, that will raise a scandal. It ought not to be allowed. Besides,
she is very ill. Perhaps you had not remarked that?”
“Yes, I have. It was I who told you about it. Had she not been ill, she would not
have gone and spent the night with you.”
“Then you know all about it?”
“Yes; for last night she was to have accompanied me to the house of a relative
134
of mine. Unfortunately, being ill, she made a mistake, and went to your rooms
instead.”
“Indeed? Then I wish you joy, Mr. Astley. Apropos, you have reminded me of
something. Were you beneath my window last night? Every moment Mlle.
Polina kept telling me to open the window and see if you were there; after
which she always smiled.”
“Indeed? No, I was not there; but I was waiting in the corridor, and walking
about the hotel.”
“She ought to see a doctor, you know, Mr. Astley.”
“Yes, she ought. I have sent for one, and, if she dies, I shall hold you
responsible.”
This surprised me.
“Pardon me,” I replied, “but what do you mean?”
“Never mind. Tell me if it is true that, last night, you won two hundred
thousand thalers?”
“No; I won a hundred thousand florins.”
“Good heavens! Then I suppose you will be off to Paris this morning?
“Why?”
“Because all Russians who have grown rich go to Paris,” explained Astley, as
though he had read the fact in a book.
“But what could I do in Paris in summer time?--I LOVE her, Mr. Astley! Surely
you know that?”
“Indeed? I am sure that you do NOT. Moreover, if you were to stay here, you
would lose everything that you possess, and have nothing left with which to
pay your expenses in Paris. Well, good-bye now. I feel sure that today will see
you gone from here.”
“Good-bye. But I am NOT going to Paris. Likewise--pardon me--what is to
135
become of this family? I mean that the affair of the General and Mlle. Polina will
soon be all over the town.”
“I daresay; yet, I hardly suppose that that will break the General’s heart.
Moreover, Mlle. Polina has a perfect right to live where she chooses. In short,
we may say that, as a family, this family has ceased to exist.”
I departed, and found myself smiling at the Englishman’s strange assurance
that I should soon be leaving for Paris. “I suppose he means to shoot me in a
duel, should Polina die. Yes, that is what he intends to do.” Now, although I
was honestly sorry for Polina, it is a fact that, from the moment when, the
previous night, I had approached the gaming-table, and begun to rake in the
packets of bank-notes, my love for her had entered upon a new plane. Yes, I
can say that now; although, at the time, I was barely conscious of it. Was I,
then, at heart a gambler? Did I, after all, love Polina not so very much? No, no!
As God is my witness, I loved her! Even when I was returning home from Mr.
Astley’s my suffering was genuine, and my self-reproach sincere. But presently
I was to go through an exceedingly strange and ugly experience.
I was proceeding to the General’s rooms when I heard a door near me open,
and a voice call me by name. It was Mlle.’s mother, the Widow de Cominges
who was inviting me, in her daughter’s name, to enter.
I did so; whereupon, I heard a laugh and a little cry proceed from the bedroom
(the pair occupied a suite of two apartments), where Mlle. Blanche was just
arising.
“Ah, c’est lui! Viens, donc, bete! Is it true that you have won a mountain of
gold and silver? J’aimerais mieux l’or.”
“Yes,” I replied with a smile.
“How much?”
“A hundred thousand florins.”
“Bibi, comme tu es bete! Come in here, for I can’t hear you where you are now.
Nous ferons bombance, n’est-ce pas?”
136
Entering her room, I found her lolling under a pink satin coverlet, and revealing
a pair of swarthy, wonderfully healthy shoulders--shoulders such as one sees in
dreams--shoulders covered over with a white cambric nightgown which,
trimmed with lace, stood out, in striking relief, against the darkness of her skin.
“Mon fils, as-tu du coeur?” she cried when she saw me, and then giggled. Her
laugh had always been a very cheerful one, and at times it even sounded
sincere.
“Tout autre--“ I began, paraphrasing Comeille.
“See here,” she prattled on. “Please search for my stockings, and help me to
dress. Aussi, si tu n’es pas trop bete je te prends a Paris. I am just off, let me
tell you.”
“This moment?”
“In half an hour.”
True enough, everything stood ready-packed--trunks, portmanteaux, and all.
Coffee had long been served.
“Eh bien, tu verras Paris. Dis donc, qu’est-ce que c’est qu’un ‘utchitel’? Tu etais
bien bete quand tu etais ‘utchitel.’ Where are my stockings? Please help me to
dress.”
And she lifted up a really ravishing foot--small, swarthy, and not misshapen like
the majority of feet which look dainty only in bottines. I laughed, and started to
draw on to the foot a silk stocking, while Mlle. Blanche sat on the edge of the
bed and chattered.
“Eh bien, que feras-tu si je te prends avec moi? First of all I must have fifty
thousand francs, and you shall give them to me at Frankfurt. Then we will go
on to Paris, where we will live together, et je te ferai voir des etoiles en plein
jour. Yes, you shall see such women as your eyes have never lit upon.”
“Stop a moment. If I were to give you those fifty thousand francs, what should
I have left for myself?”
137
“Another hundred thousand francs, please to remember. Besides, I could live
with you in your rooms for a month, or even for two; or even for longer. But it
would not take us more than two months to get through fifty thousand francs;
for, look you, je suis bonne enfante, et tu verras des etoiles, you may be sure.”
“What? You mean to say that we should spend the whole in two months?”
“Certainly. Does that surprise you very much? Ah, vil esclave! Why, one month
of that life would be better than all your previous existence. One month--et
apres, le deluge! Mais tu ne peux comprendre. Va! Away, away! You are not
worth it.--Ah, que fais-tu?”
For, while drawing on the other stocking, I had felt constrained to kiss her.
Immediately she shrunk back, kicked me in the face with her toes, and turned
me neck and prop out of the room.
“Eh bien, mon ‘utchitel’,” she called after me, “je t’attends, si tu veux. I start in
a quarter of an hour’s time.”
I returned to my own room with my head in a whirl. It was not my fault that
Polina had thrown a packet in my face, and preferred Mr. Astley to myself. A
few bank-notes were still fluttering about the floor, and I picked them up. At
that moment the door opened, and the landlord appeared--a person who, until
now, had never bestowed upon me so much as a glance. He had come to know
if I would prefer to move to a lower floor--to a suite which had just been
tenanted by Count V.
For a moment I reflected.
“No!” I shouted. “My account, please, for in ten minutes I shall be gone.”
“To Paris, to Paris!” I added to myself. “Every man of birth must make her
acquaintance.”
Within a quarter of an hour all three of us were seated in a family
compartment--Mlle. Blanche, the Widow de Cominges, and myself. Mlle. kept
laughing hysterically as she looked at me, and Madame re-echoed her; but I
did not feel so cheerful. My life had broken in two, and yesterday had infected
138
me with a habit of staking my all upon a card. Although it might be that I had
failed to win my stake, that I had lost my senses, that I desired nothing better,
I felt that the scene was to be changed only FOR A TIME. “Within a month from
now,” I kept thinking to myself, “I shall be back again in Roulettenberg; and
THEN I mean to have it out with you, Mr. Astley!” Yes, as now I look back at
things, I remember that I felt greatly depressed, despite the absurd gigglings
of the egregious Blanche.
“What is the matter with you? How dull you are!” she cried at length as she
interrupted her laughter to take me seriously to task.
“Come, come! We are going to spend your two hundred thousand francs for
you, et tu seras heureux comme un petit roi. I myself will tie your tie for you,
and introduce you to Hortense. And when we have spent your money you shall
return here, and break the bank again. What did those two Jews tell you?--that
the thing most needed is daring, and that you possess it? Consequently, this is
not the first time that you will be hurrying to Paris with money in your pocket.
Quant ... moi, je veux cinquante mille francs de rente, et alors”
“But what about the General?” I interrupted.
“The General? You know well enough that at about this hour every day he goes
to buy me a bouquet. On this occasion, I took care to tell him that he must
hunt for the choicest of flowers; and when he returns home, the poor fellow will
find the bird flown. Possibly he may take wing in pursuit--ha, ha, ha! And if so,
I shall not be sorry, for he could be useful to me in Paris, and Mr. Astley will
pay his debts here.”
In this manner did I depart for the Gay City.
XVI
Of Paris what am I to say? The whole proceeding was a delirium, a madness. I
spent a little over three weeks there, and, during that time, saw my hundred
thousand francs come to an end. I speak only of the ONE hundred thousand
francs, for the other hundred thousand I gave to Mlle. Blanche in pure cash.
That is to say, I handed her fifty thousand francs at Frankfurt, and, three days
139
later (in Paris), advanced her another fifty thousand on note of hand.
Nevertheless, a week had not elapsed ere she came to me for more money. “Et
les cent mille francs qui nous restent,” she added, “tu les mangeras avec moi,
mon utchitel.” Yes, she always called me her “utchitel.” A person more
economical, grasping, and mean than Mlle. Blanche one could not imagine. But
this was only as regards HER OWN money. MY hundred thousand francs (as she
explained to me later) she needed to set up her establishment in Paris, “so that
once and for all I may be on a decent footing, and proof against any stones
which may be thrown at me--at all events for a long time to come.”
Nevertheless, I saw nothing of those hundred thousand francs, for my own
purse (which she inspected daily) never managed to amass in it more than a
hundred francs at a time; and, generally the sum did not reach even that
figure.
“What do you want with money?” she would say to me with air of absolute
simplicity; and I never disputed the point. Nevertheless, though she fitted out
her flat very badly with the money, the fact did not prevent her from saying
when, later, she was showing me over the rooms of her new abode: “See what
care and taste can do with the most wretched of means!” However, her
“wretchedness “ had cost fifty thousand francs, while with the remaining fifty
thousand she purchased a carriage and horses.
Also, we gave a couple of balls--evening parties attended by Hortense and
Lisette and Cleopatre, who were women remarkable both for the number of
their liaisons and (though only in some cases) for their good looks. At these
reunions I had to play the part of host--to meet and entertain fat mercantile
parvenus who were impossible by reason of their rudeness and braggadocio,
colonels of various kinds, hungry authors, and journalistic hacks--all of whom
disported themselves in fashionable tailcoats and pale yellow gloves, and
displayed such an aggregate of conceit and gasconade as would be unthinkable
even in St. Petersburg--which is saying a great deal! They used to try to make
fun of me, but I would console myself by drinking champagne and then lolling
in a retiring-room. Nevertheless, I found it deadly work. “C’est un utchitel,”
Blanche would say of me, “qui a gagne deux cent mille francs, and but for me,
would have had not a notion how to spend them. Presently he will have to
140
return to his tutoring. Does any one know of a vacant post? You know, one
must do something for him.”
I had the more frequent recourse to champagne in that I constantly felt
depressed and bored, owing to the fact that I was living in the most bourgeois
commercial milieu imaginable--a milieu wherein every sou was counted and
grudged. Indeed, two weeks had not elapsed before I perceived that Blanche
had no real affection for me, even though she dressed me in elegant clothes,
and herself tied my tie each day. In short, she utterly despised me. But that
caused me no concern. Blase and inert, I spent my evenings generally at the
Chateau des Fleurs, where I would get fuddled and then dance the cancan
(which, in that establishment, was a very indecent performance) with eclat. At
length, the time came when Blanche had drained my purse dry. She had
conceived an idea that, during the term of our residence together, it would be
well if I were always to walk behind her with a paper and pencil, in order to jot
down exactly what she spent, what she had saved, what she was paying out,
and what she was laying by. Well, of course I could not fail to be aware that
this would entail a battle over every ten francs; so, although for every possible
objection that I might make she had prepared a suitable answer, she soon saw
that I made no objections, and therefore, had to start disputes herself. That is
to say, she would burst out into tirades which were met only with silence as I
lolled on a sofa and stared fixedly at the ceiling. This greatly surprised her. At
first she imagined that it was due merely to the fact that I was a fool, “un
utchitel”; wherefore she would break off her harangue in the belief that, being
too stupid to understand, I was a hopeless case. Then she would leave the
room, but return ten minutes later to resume the contest. This continued
throughout her squandering of my money--a squandering altogether out of
proportion to our means. An example is the way in which she changed her first
pair of horses for a pair which cost sixteen thousand francs.
“Bibi,” she said on the latter occasion as she approached me, “surely you are
not angry?”
“No-o-o: I am merely tired,” was my reply as I pushed her from me. This
seemed to her so curious that straightway she seated herself by my side.
141
“You see,” she went on, “I decided to spend so much upon these horses only
because I can easily sell them again. They would go at any time for TWENTY
thousand francs.”
“Yes, yes. They are splendid horses, and you have got a splendid turn-out. I
am quite content. Let me hear no more of the matter.”
“Then you are not angry?”
“No. Why should I be? You are wise to provide yourself with what you need, for
it will all come in handy in the future. Yes, I quite see the necessity of your
establishing yourself on a good basis, for without it you will never earn your
million. My hundred thousand francs I look upon merely as a beginning--as a
mere drop in the bucket.”
Blanche, who had by no means expected such declarations from me, but,
rather, an uproar and protests, was rather taken aback.
“Well, well, what a man you are! “ she exclaimed. “ Mais tu as l’esprit pour
comprendre. Sais-tu, mon garcon, although you are a tutor, you ought to have
been born a prince. Are you not sorry that your money should be going so
quickly?”
“No. The quicker it goes the better.”
“Mais--sais-tu-mais dis donc, are you really rich? Mais sais-tu, you have too
much contempt for money. Qu’est-ce que tu feras apres, dis donc?”
“Apres I shall go to Homburg, and win another hundred thousand francs.”
“Oui, oui, c’est ca, c’est magnifique! Ah, I know you will win them, and bring
them to me when you have done so. Dis donc--you will end by making me love
you. Since you are what you are, I mean to love you all the time, and never to
be unfaithful to you. You see, I have not loved you before parce que je croyais
que tu n’es qu’un utchitel (quelque chose comme un lacquais, n’est-ce pas?)
Yet all the time I have been true to you, parce que je suis bonne fille.”
“You lie!” I interrupted. “Did I not see you, the other day, with Albert--with that
black-jowled officer?”
142
“Oh, oh! Mais tu es--“
”Yes, you are lying right enough. But what makes you suppose that I should be
angry? Rubbish! Il faut que jeunesse se passe. Even if that officer were here
now, I should refrain from putting him out of the room if I thought you really
cared for him. Only, mind you, do not give him any of my money. You hear?”
“You say, do you, that you would not be angry? Mais tu es un vrai philosophe,
sais-tu? Oui, un vrai philosophe! Eh bien, je t’aimerai, je t’aimerai. Tu verras-tu
seras content.”
True enough, from that time onward she seemed to attach herself only to me,
and in this manner we spent our last ten days together. The promised “etoiles”
I did not see, but in other respects she, to a certain extent, kept her word.
Moreover, she introduced me to Hortense, who was a remarkable woman in her
way, and known among us as Therese Philosophe.
But I need not enlarge further, for to do so would require a story to itself, and
entail a colouring which I am lothe to impart to the present narrative. The point
is that with all my faculties I desired the episode to come to an end as speedily
as possible. Unfortunately, our hundred thousand francs lasted us, as I have
said, for very nearly a month--which greatly surprised me. At all events,
Blanche bought herself articles to the tune of eighty thousand francs, and the
rest sufficed just to meet our expenses of living. Towards the close of the
affair, Blanche grew almost frank with me (at least, she scarcely lied to me at
all)--declaring, amongst other things, that none of the debts which she had
been obliged to incur were going to fall upon my head. “I have purposely
refrained from making you responsible for my bills or borrowings,” she said,
“for the reason that I am sorry for you. Any other woman in my place would
have done so, and have let you go to prison. See, then, how much I love you,
and how good-hearted I am! Think, too, what this accursed marriage with the
General is going to cost me!”
True enough, the marriage took place. It did so at the close of our month
together, and I am bound to suppose that it was upon the ceremony that the
last remnants of my money were spent. With it the episode--that is to say, my
143
sojourn with the Frenchwoman--came to an end, and I formally retired from
the scene.
It happened thus: A week after we had taken up our abode in Paris there
arrived thither the General. He came straight to see us, and thenceforward
lived with us practically as our guest, though he had a flat of his own as well.
Blanche met him with merry badinage and laughter, and even threw her arms
around him. In fact, she managed it so that he had to follow everywhere in her
train--whether when promenading on the Boulevards, or when driving, or when
going to the theatre, or when paying calls; and this use which she made of him
quite satisfied the General. Still of imposing appearance and presence, as well
as of fair height, he had a dyed moustache and whiskers (he had formerly been
in the cuirassiers), and a handsome, though a somewhat wrinkled, face. Also,
his manners were excellent, and he could carry a frockcoat well--the more so
since, in Paris, he took to wearing his orders. To promenade the Boulevards
with such a man was not only a thing possible, but also, so to speak, a thing
advisable, and with this programme the good but foolish General had not a
fault to find. The truth is that he had never counted upon this programme when
he came to Paris to seek us out. On that occasion he had made his appearance
nearly shaking with terror, for he had supposed that Blanche would at once
raise an outcry, and have him put from the door; wherefore, he was the more
enraptured at the turn that things had taken, and spent the month in a state of
senseless ecstasy. Already I had learnt that, after our unexpected departure
from Roulettenberg, he had had a sort of a fit--that he had fallen into a swoon,
and spent a week in a species of garrulous delirium. Doctors had been
summoned to him, but he had broken away from them, and suddenly taken a
train to Paris. Of course Blanche’s reception of him had acted as the best of all
possible cures, but for long enough he carried the marks of his affliction,
despite his present condition of rapture and delight. To think clearly, or even to
engage in any serious conversation, had now become impossible for him; he
could only ejaculate after each word “Hm!” and then nod his head in
confirmation. Sometimes, also, he would laugh, but only in a nervous,
hysterical sort of a fashion; while at other times he would sit for hours looking
as black as night, with his heavy eyebrows knitted. Of much that went on he
144
remained wholly oblivious, for he grew extremely absent-minded, and took to
talking to himself. Only Blanche could awake him to any semblance of life. His
fits of depression and moodiness in corners always meant either that he had
not seen her for some while, or that she had gone out without taking him with
her, or that she had omitted to caress him before departing. When in this
condition, he would refuse to say what he wanted--nor had he the least idea
that he was thus sulking and moping. Next, after remaining in this condition for
an hour or two (this I remarked on two occasions when Blanche had gone out
for the day--probably to see Albert), he would begin to look about him, and to
grow uneasy, and to hurry about with an air as though he had suddenly
remembered something, and must try and find it; after which, not perceiving
the object of his search, nor succeeding in recalling what that object had been,
he would as suddenly relapse into oblivion, and continue so until the
reappearance of Blanche--merry, wanton, half-dressed, and laughing her
strident laugh as she approached to pet him, and even to kiss him (though the
latter reward he seldom received). Once, he was so overjoyed at her doing so
that he burst into tears. Even I myself was surprised.
From the first moment of his arrival in Paris, Blanche set herself to plead with
me on his behalf; and at such times she even rose to heights of
eloquence--saying that it was for ME she had abandoned him, though she had
almost become his betrothed and promised to become so; that it was for HER
sake he had deserted his family; that, having been in his service, I ought to
remember the fact, and to feel ashamed. To all this I would say nothing,
however much she chattered on; until at length I would burst out laughing, and
the incident would come to an end (at first, as I have said, she had thought me
a fool, but since she had come to deem me a man of sense and sensibility). In
short, I had the happiness of calling her better nature into play; for though, at
first, I had not deemed her so, she was, in reality, a kind-hearted woman after
her own fashion. “You are good and clever,” she said to me towards the finish,
“and my one regret is that you are also so wrong-headed. You will NEVER be a
rich man!”
“Un vrai Russe--un Kalmuk” she usually called me.
145
Several times she sent me to give the General an airing in the streets, even as
she might have done with a lacquey and her spaniel; but, I preferred to take
him to the theatre, to the Bal Mabille, and to restaurants. For this purpose she
usually allowed me some money, though the General had a little of his own,
and enjoyed taking out his purse before strangers. Once I had to use actual
force to prevent him from buying a phaeton at a price of seven hundred francs,
after a vehicle had caught his fancy in the Palais Royal as seeming to be a
desirable present for Blanche. What could SHE have done with a
seven-hundred-franc phaeton?--and the General possessed in the world but a
thousand francs! The origin even of those francs I could never determine, but
imagined them to have emanated from Mr. Astley--the more so since the latter
had paid the family’s hotel bill. As for what view the General took of myself, I
think that he never divined the footing on which I stood with Blanche. True, he
had heard, in a dim sort of way, that I had won a good deal of money; but
more probably he supposed me to be acting as secretary--or even as a kind of
servant--to his inamorata. At all events, he continued to address me, in his old
haughty style, as my superior. At times he even took it upon himself to scold
me. One morning in particular, he started to sneer at me over our matutinal
coffee. Though not a man prone to take offence, he suddenly, and for some
reason of which to this day I am ignorant, fell out with me. Of course even he
himself did not know the reason. To put things shortly, he began a speech
which had neither beginning nor ending, and cried out, a batons rompus, that I
was a boy whom he would soon put to rights--and so forth, and so forth. Yet no
one could understand what he was saying, and at length Blanche exploded in a
burst of laughter. Finally something appeased him, and he was taken out for
his walk. More than once, however, I noticed that his depression was growing
upon him; that he seemed to be feeling the want of somebody or something;
that, despite Blanche’s presence, he was missing some person in particular.
Twice, on these occasions, did he plunge into a conversation with me, though
he could not make himself intelligible, and only went on rambling about the
service, his late wife, his home, and his property. Every now and then, also,
some particular word would please him; whereupon he would repeat it a
hundred times in the day--even though the word happened to express neither
his thoughts nor his feelings. Again, I would try to get him to talk about his
146
children, but always he cut me short in his old snappish way, and passed to
another subject. “Yes, yes--my children,” was all that I could extract from him.
“Yes, you are right in what you have said about them.” Only once did he
disclose his real feelings. That was when we were taking him to the theatre,
and suddenly he exclaimed: “My unfortunate children! Yes, sir, they are
unfortunate children.” Once, too, when I chanced to mention Polina, he grew
quite bitter against her. “She is an ungrateful woman!” he exclaimed. “She is a
bad and ungrateful woman! She has broken up a family. If there were laws
here, I would have her impaled. Yes, I would.” As for De Griers, the General
would not have his name mentioned. “ He has ruined me,” he would say. “He
has robbed me, and cut my throat. For two years he was a perfect nightmare
to me. For months at a time he never left me in my dreams. Do not speak of
him again.”
It was now clear to me that Blanche and he were on the point of coming to
terms; yet, true to my usual custom, I said nothing. At length, Blanche took
the initiative in explaining matters. She did so a week before we parted.
“Il a du chance,” she prattled, “for the Grandmother is now REALLY ill, and
therefore, bound to die. Mr. Astley has just sent a telegram to say so, and you
will agree with me that the General is likely to be her heir. Even if he should
not be so, he will not come amiss, since, in the first place, he has his pension,
and, in the second place, he will be content to live in a back room; whereas I
shall be Madame General, and get into a good circle of society” (she was
always thinking of this) “and become a Russian chatelaine. Yes, I shall have a
mansion of my own, and peasants, and a million of money at my back.”
“But, suppose he should prove jealous? He might demand all sorts of things,
you know. Do you follow me?”
“Oh, dear no! How ridiculous that would be of him! Besides, I have taken
measures to prevent it. You need not be alarmed. That is to say, I have
induced him to sign notes of hand in Albert’s name. Consequently, at any time
I could get him punished. Isn’t he ridiculous?”
“Very well, then. Marry him.”
147
And, in truth, she did so--though the marriage was a family one only, and
involved no pomp or ceremony. In fact, she invited to the nuptials none but
Albert and a few other friends. Hortense, Cleopatre, and the rest she kept
firmly at a distance. As for the bridegroom, he took a great interest in his new
position. Blanche herself tied his tie, and Blanche herself pomaded him-- with
the result that, in his frockcoat and white waistcoat, he looked quite comme il
faut.
“Il est, pourtant, TRES comme il faut,” Blanche remarked when she issued from
his room, as though the idea that he was “TRES comme il faut “ had impressed
even her. For myself, I had so little knowledge of the minor details of the affair,
and took part in it so much as a supine spectator, that I have forgotten most of
what passed on this occasion. I only remember that Blanche and the Widow
figured at it, not as “de Cominges,” but as “du Placet.” Why they had hitherto
been “de Cominges “ I do not know--I only know that this entirely satisfied the
General, that he liked the name “du Placet” even better than he had liked the
name “de Cominges.” On the morning of the wedding, he paced the salon in his
gala attire and kept repeating to himself with an air of great gravity and
importance: “ Mlle. Blanche du Placet! Mlle. Blanche du Placet, du Placet!” He
beamed with satisfaction as he did so. Both in the church and at the wedding
breakfast he remained not only pleased and contented, but even proud. She
too underwent a change, for now she assumed an air of added dignity.
“I must behave altogether differently,” she confided to me with a serious air.
“Yet, mark you, there is a tiresome circumstance of which I had never before
thought--which is, how best to pronounce my new family name. Zagorianski,
Zagozianski, Madame la Generale de Sago, Madame la Generale de Fourteen
Consonants--oh these infernal Russian names! The LAST of them would be the
best to use, don’t you think?”
At length the time had come for us to part, and Blanche, the egregious
Blanche, shed real tears as she took her leave of me. “Tu etais bon enfant” she
said with a sob. “je te croyais bete et tu en avais l’air, but it suited you.” Then,
having given me a final handshake, she exclaimed, “Attends!”; whereafter,
running into her boudoir, she brought me thence two thousand-franc notes. I
148
could scarcely believe my eyes! “They may come in handy for you,” she
explained, “for, though you are a very learned tutor, you are a very stupid
man. More than two thousand francs, however, I am not going to give you, for
the reason that, if I did so, you would gamble them all away. Now good-bye.
Nous serons toujours bons amis, and if you win again, do not fail to come to
me, et tu seras heureux.”
I myself had still five hundred francs left, as well as a watch worth a thousand
francs, a few diamond studs, and so on. Consequently, I could subsist for quite
a length of time without particularly bestirring myself. Purposely I have taken
up my abode where I am now partly to pull myself together, and partly to wait
for Mr. Astley, who, I have learnt, will soon be here for a day or so on business.
Yes, I know that, and then--and then I shall go to Homburg. But to
Roulettenberg I shall not go until next year, for they say it is bad to try one’s
luck twice in succession at a table. Moreover, Homburg is where the best play
is carried on.
XVII
It is a year and eight months since I last looked at these notes of mine. I do so
now only because, being overwhelmed with depression, I wish to distract my
mind by reading them through at random. I left them off at the point where I
was just going to Homburg. My God, with what a light heart (comparatively
speaking) did I write the concluding lines!--though it may be not so much with
a light heart, as with a measure of self-confidence and unquenchable hope. At
that time had I any doubts of myself ? Yet behold me now. Scarcely a year and
a half have passed, yet I am in a worse position than the meanest beggar. But
what is a beggar? A fig for beggary! I have ruined myself--that is all. Nor is
there anything with which I can compare myself; there is no moral which it
would be of any use for you to read to me. At the present moment nothing
could well be more incongruous than a moral. Oh, you self-satisfied persons
who, in your unctuous pride, are forever ready to mouth your maxims--if only
you knew how fully I myself comprehend the sordidness of my present state,
you would not trouble to wag your tongues at me! What could you say to me
that I do not already know? Well, wherein lies my difficulty? It lies in the fact
149
that by a single turn of a roulette wheel everything for me, has become
changed. Yet, had things befallen otherwise, these moralists would have been
among the first (yes, I feel persuaded of it) to approach me with friendly jests
and congratulations. Yes, they would never have turned from me as they are
doing now! A fig for all of them! What am I? I am zero--nothing. What shall I
be tomorrow? I may be risen from the dead, and have begun life anew. For
still, I may discover the man in myself, if only my manhood has not become
utterly shattered.
I went, I say, to Homburg, but afterwards went also to Roulettenberg, as well
as to Spa and Baden; in which latter place, for a time, I acted as valet to a
certain rascal of a Privy Councillor, by name Heintze, who until lately was also
my master here. Yes, for five months I lived my life with lacqueys! That was
just after I had come out of Roulettenberg prison, where I had lain for a small
debt which I owed. Out of that prison I was bailed by--by whom? By Mr.
Astley? By Polina? I do not know. At all events, the debt was paid to the tune of
two hundred thalers, and I sallied forth a free man. But what was I to do with
myself ? In my dilemma I had recourse to this Heintze, who was a young
scapegrace, and the sort of man who could speak and write three languages. At
first I acted as his secretary, at a salary of thirty gulden a month, but
afterwards I became his lacquey, for the reason that he could not afford to
keep a secretary--only an unpaid servant. I had nothing else to turn to, so I
remained with him, and allowed myself to become his flunkey. But by stinting
myself in meat and drink I saved, during my five months of service, some
seventy gulden; and one evening, when we were at Baden, I told him that I
wished to resign my post, and then hastened to betake myself to roulette.
Oh, how my heart beat as I did so! No, it was not the money that I
valued--what I wanted was to make all this mob of Heintzes, hotel proprietors,
and fine ladies of Baden talk about me, recount my story, wonder at me, extol
my doings, and worship my winnings. True, these were childish fancies and
aspirations, but who knows but that I might meet Polina, and be able to tell her
everything, and see her look of surprise at the fact that I had overcome so
many adverse strokes of fortune. No, I had no desire for money for its own
sake, for I was perfectly well aware that I should only squander it upon some
150
new Blanche, and spend another three weeks in Paris after buying a pair of
horses which had cost sixteen thousand francs. No, I never believed myself to
be a hoarder; in fact, I knew only too well that I was a spendthrift. And
already, with a sort of fear, a sort of sinking in my heart, I could hear the cries
of the croupiers-- “Trente et un, rouge, impair et passe,” “Quarte, noir, pair et
manque. “ How greedily I gazed upon the gaming-table, with its scattered louis
d’or, ten-gulden pieces, and thalers; upon the streams of gold as they issued
from the croupier’s hands, and piled themselves up into heaps of gold
scintillating as fire; upon the ell--long rolls of silver lying around the croupier.
Even at a distance of two rooms I could hear the chink of that money--so much
so that I nearly fell into convulsions.
Ah, the evening when I took those seventy gulden to the gaming table was a
memorable one for me. I began by staking ten gulden upon passe. For passe I
had always had a sort of predilection, yet I lost my stake upon it. This left me
with sixty gulden in silver. After a moment’s thought I selected zero--beginning
by staking five gulden at a time. Twice I lost, but the third round suddenly
brought up the desired coup. I could almost have died with joy as I received
my one hundred and seventy-five gulden. Indeed, I have been less pleased
when, in former times, I have won a hundred thousand gulden. Losing no time,
I staked another hundred gulden upon the red, and won; two hundred upon the
red, and won; four hundred upon the black, and won; eight hundred upon
manque, and won. Thus, with the addition of the remainder of my original
capital, I found myself possessed, within five minutes, of seventeen hundred
gulden. Ah, at such moments one forgets both oneself and one’s former
failures! This I had gained by risking my very life. I had dared so to risk, and
behold, again I was a member of mankind!
I went and hired a room, I shut myself up in it, and sat counting my money
until three o’clock in the morning. To think that when I awoke on the morrow, I
was no lacquey! I decided to leave at once for Homburg. There I should neither
have to serve as a footman nor to lie in prison. Half an hour before starting, I
went and ventured a couple of stakes--no more; with the result that, in all, I
lost fifteen hundred florins. Nevertheless, I proceeded to Homburg, and have
now been there for a month.
151
Of course, I am living in constant trepidation,playing for the smallest of stakes,
and always looking out for something--calculating, standing whole days by the
gaming-tables to watch the play--even seeing that play in my dreams--yet
seeming, the while, to be in some way stiffening, to be growing caked, as it
were, in mire. But I must conclude my notes, which I finish under the
impression of a recent encounter with Mr. Astley. I had not seen him since we
parted at Roulettenberg, and now we met quite by accident. At the time I was
walking in the public gardens, and meditating upon the fact that not only had I
still some fifty olden in my possession, but also I had fully paid up my hotel bill
three days ago. Consequently, I was in a position to try my luck again at
roulette; and if I won anything I should be able to continue my play, whereas,
if I lost what I now possessed, I should once more have to accept a lacquey’s
place, provided that, in the alternative, I failed to discover a Russian family
which stood in need of a tutor. Plunged in these reflections, I started on my
daily walk through the Park and forest towards a neighbouring principality.
Sometimes, on such occasions, I spent four hours on the way, and would
return to Homburg tired and hungry; but, on this particular occasion, I had
scarcely left the gardens for the Park when I caught sight of Astley seated on a
bench. As soon as he perceived me, he called me by name, and I went and sat
down beside him; but, on noticing that he seemed a little stiff in his manner, I
hastened to moderate the expression of joy which the sight of him had called
forth.
“YOU here?” he said. “Well, I had an idea that I should meet you. Do not
trouble to tell me anything, for I know all--yes, all. In fact, your whole life
during the past twenty months lies within my knowledge.”
“How closely you watch the doings of your old friends!” I replied. “That does
you infinite credit. But stop a moment. You have reminded me of something.
Was it you who bailed me out of Roulettenberg prison when I was lying there
for a debt of two hundred gulden? SOMEONE did so.”
“Oh dear no!--though I knew all the time that you were lying there.”
“Perhaps you could tell me who DID bail me out?”
152
“No; I am afraid I could not.”
“What a strange thing! For I know no Russians at all here, so it cannot have
been a Russian who befriended me. In Russia we Orthodox folk DO go bail for
one another, but in this case I thought it must have been done by some English
stranger who was not conversant with the ways of the country.”
Mr. Astley seemed to listen to me with a sort of surprise. Evidently he had
expected to see me looking more crushed and broken than I was.
“Well,” he said--not very pleasantly, “I am none the less glad to find that you
retain your old independence of spirit, as well as your buoyancy.”
“Which means that you are vexed at not having found me more abased and
humiliated than I am?” I retorted with a smile.
Astley was not quick to understand this, but presently did so and laughed.
“Your remarks please me as they always did,” he continued. “In those words I
see the clever, triumphant, and, above all things, cynical friend of former days.
Only Russians have the faculty of combining within themselves so many
opposite qualities. Yes, most men love to see their best friend in abasement;
for generally it is on such abasement that friendship is founded. All thinking
persons know that ancient truth. Yet, on the present occasion, I assure you, I
am sincerely glad to see that you are NOT cast down. Tell me, are you never
going to give up gambling?”
“Damn the gambling! Yes, I should certainly have given it up, were it not
that--“
”That you are losing? I thought so. You need not tell me any more. I know how
things stand, for you have said that last in despair, and therefore, truthfully.
Have you no other employment than gambling?”
“No; none whatever.”
Astley gave me a searching glance. At that time it was ages since I had last
looked at a paper or turned the pages of a book.
153
“You are growing blase,” he said. “You have not only renounced life, with its
interests and social ties, but the duties of a citizen and a man; you have not
only renounced the friends whom I know you to have had, and every aim in life
but that of winning money; but you have also renounced your memory. Though
I can remember you in the strong, ardent period of your life, I feel persuaded
that you have now forgotten every better feeling of that period--that your
present dreams and aspirations of subsistence do not rise above pair, impair
rouge, noir, the twelve middle numbers, and so forth.”
“Enough, Mr. Astley!” I cried with some irritation--almost in anger. “Kindly do
not recall to me any more recollections, for I can remember things for myself.
Only for a time have I put them out of my head. Only until I shall have
rehabilitated myself, am I keeping my memory dulled. When that hour shall
come, you will see me arise from the dead.”
“Then you will have to be here another ten years,” he replied. “Should I then
be alive, I will remind you--here, on this very bench--of what I have just said.
In fact, I will bet you a wager that I shall do so.”
“Say no more,” I interrupted impatiently. “And to show you that I have not
wholly forgotten the past, may I enquire where Mlle. Polina is? If it was not you
who bailed me out of prison, it must have been she. Yet never have I heard a
word concerning her.”
“No, I do not think it was she. At the present moment she is in Switzerland,
and you will do me a favour by ceasing to ask me these questions about her.”
Astley said this with a firm, and even an angry, air.
“Which means that she has dealt you a serious wound?” I burst out with an
involuntary sneer.
“Mlle. Polina,” he continued, “Is the best of all possible living beings; but, I
repeat, that I shall thank you to cease questioning me about her. You never
really knew her, and her name on your lips is an offence to my moral feeling.”
“Indeed? On what subject, then, have I a better right to speak to you than on
this? With it are bound up all your recollections and mine. However, do not be
154
alarmed: I have no wish to probe too far into your private, your secret affairs.
My interest in Mlle. Polina does not extend beyond her outward circumstances
and surroundings. About them you could tell me in two words.”
“Well, on condition that the matter shall end there, I will tell you that for a long
time Mlle. Polina was ill, and still is so. My mother and sister entertained her for
a while at their home in the north of England, and thereafter Mlle. Polina’s
grandmother (you remember the mad old woman?) died, and left Mlle. Polina a
personal legacy of seven thousand pounds sterling. That was about six months
ago, and now Mlle. is travelling with my sister’s family--my sister having since
married. Mlle.’s little brother and sister also benefited by the Grandmother’s
will, and are now being educated in London. As for the General, he died in Paris
last month, of a stroke. Mlle. Blanche did well by him, for she succeeded in
having transferred to herself all that he received from the Grandmother. That, I
think, concludes all that I have to tell.”
“And De Griers? Is he too travelling in Switzerland?”
“No; nor do I know where he is. Also I warn you once more that you had better
avoid such hints and ignoble suppositions; otherwise you will assuredly have to
reckon with me.”
“What? In spite of our old friendship?”
“Yes, in spite of our old friendship.”
“Then I beg your pardon a thousand times, Mr. Astley. I meant nothing
offensive to Mlle. Polina, for I have nothing of which to accuse her. Moreover,
the question of there being anything between this Frenchman and this Russian
lady is not one which you and I need discuss, nor even attempt to understand.”
“If,” replied Astley, “you do not care to hear their names coupled together, may
I ask you what you mean by the expressions ‘this Frenchman,’ ‘this Russian
lady,’ and ‘there being anything between them’? Why do you call them so
particularly a ‘Frenchman’ and a ‘Russian lady’?”
“Ah, I see you are interested, Mr. Astley. But it is a long, long story, and calls
for a lengthy preface. At the same time, the question is an important one,
155
however ridiculous it may seem at the first glance. A Frenchman, Mr. Astley, is
merely a fine figure of a man. With this you, as a Britisher, may not agree.
With it I also, as a Russian, may not agree--out of envy. Yet possibly our good
ladies are of another opinion. For instance, one may look upon Racine as a
broken-down, hobbledehoy, perfumed individual--one may even be unable to
read him; and I too may think him the same, as well as, in some respects, a
subject for ridicule. Yet about him, Mr. Astley, there is a certain charm, and,
above all things, he is a great poet--though one might like to deny it. Yes, the
Frenchman, the Parisian, as a national figure, was in process of developing into
a figure of elegance before we Russians had even ceased to be bears. The
Revolution bequeathed to the French nobility its heritage, and now every
whippersnapper of a Parisian may possess manners, methods of expression,
and even thoughts that are above reproach in form, while all the time he
himself may share in that form neither in initiative nor in intellect nor in
soul--his manners, and the rest, having come to him through inheritance. Yes,
taken by himself, the Frenchman is frequently a fool of fools and a villain of
villains. Per contra, there is no one in the world more worthy of confidence and
respect than this young Russian lady. De Griers might so mask his face and
play a part as easily to overcome her heart, for he has an imposing figure, Mr.
Astley, and this young lady might easily take that figure for his real self--for
the natural form of his heart and soul--instead of the mere cloak with which
heredity has dowered him. And even though it may offend you, I feel bound to
say that the majority also of English people are uncouth and unrefined,
whereas we Russian folk can recognise beauty wherever we see it, and are
always eager to cultivate the same. But to distinguish beauty of soul and
personal originality there is needed far more independence and freedom than is
possessed by our women, especially by our younger ladies. At all events, they
need more EXPERIENCE. For instance, this Mlle. Polina--pardon me, but the
name has passed my lips, and I cannot well recall it--is taking a very long time
to make up her mind to prefer you to Monsieur de Griers. She may respect you,
she may become your friend, she may open out her heart to you; yet over that
heart there will be reigning that loathsome villain, that mean and petty usurer,
De Griers. This will be due to obstinacy and self-love--to the fact that De Griers
once appeared to her in the transfigured guise of a marquis, of a disenchanted
156
and ruined liberal who was doing his best to help her family and the frivolous
old General; and, although these transactions of his have since been exposed,
you will find that the exposure has made no impression upon her mind. Only
give her the De Griers of former days, and she will ask of you no more. The
more she may detest the present De Griers, the more will she lament the De
Griers of the past--even though the latter never existed but in her own
imagination. You are a sugar refiner, Mr. Astley, are you not?”
“Yes, I belong to the well-known firm of Lovell and Co.”
“Then see here. On the one hand, you are a sugar refiner, while, on the other
hand, you are an Apollo Belvedere. But the two characters do not mix with one
another. I, again, am not even a sugar refiner; I am a mere roulette gambler
who has also served as a lacquey. Of this fact Mlle. Polina is probably well
aware, since she appears to have an excellent force of police at her disposal.”
“You are saying this because you are feeling bitter,” said Astley with cold
indifference. “Yet there is not the least originality in your words.”
“I agree. But therein lies the horror of it all--that, however mean and farcical
my accusations may be, they are none the less TRUE. But I am only wasting
words.”
“Yes, you are, for you are only talking nonsense! exclaimed my companion--his
voice now trembling and his eyes flashing fire. “Are you aware,” he continued,
“that wretched, ignoble, petty, unfortunate man though you are, it was at HER
request I came to Homburg, in order to see you, and to have a long, serious
talk with you, and to report to her your feelings and thoughts and hopes--yes,
and your recollections of her, too?”
“Indeed? Is that really so?” I cried--the tears beginning to well from my eyes.
Never before had this happened.
“Yes, poor unfortunate,” continued Astley. “She DID love you; and I may tell
you this now for the reason that now you are utterly lost. Even if I were also to
tell you that she still loves you, you would none the less have to remain where
you are. Yes, you have ruined yourself beyond redemption. Once upon a time
157
you had a certain amount of talent, and you were of a lively disposition, and
your good looks were not to be despised. You might even have been useful to
your country, which needs men like you. Yet you remained here, and your life
is now over. I am not blaming you for this--in my view all Russians resemble
you, or are inclined to do so. If it is not roulette, then it is something else. The
exceptions are very rare. Nor are you the first to learn what a taskmaster is
yours. For roulette is not exclusively a Russian game. Hitherto, you have
honourably preferred to serve as a lacquey rather than to act as a thief; but
what the future may have in store for you I tremble to think. Now good-bye.
You are in want of money, I suppose? Then take these ten louis d’or. More I
shall not give you, for you would only gamble it away. Take care of these coins,
and farewell. Once more, TAKE CARE of them.”
“No, Mr. Astley. After all that has been said I--“
”TAKE CARE of them!” repeated my friend. “I am certain you are still a
gentleman, and therefore I give you the money as one gentleman may give
money to another. Also, if I could be certain that you would leave both
Homburg and the gaming-tables, and return to your own country, I would give
you a thousand pounds down to start life afresh; but, I give you ten louis d’or
instead of a thousand pounds for the reason that at the present time a
thousand pounds and ten louis d’or will be all the same to you--you will lose
the one as readily as you will the other. Take the money, therefore, and
good-bye.”
“Yes, I WILL take it if at the same time you will embrace me.”
“With pleasure.”
So we parted--on terms of sincere affection.
...............
But he was wrong. If I was hard and undiscerning as regards Polina and De
Griers, HE was hard and undiscerning as regards Russian people generally. Of
myself I say nothing. Yet--yet words are only words. I need to ACT. Above all
things I need to think of Switzerland. Tomorrow, tomorrow--Ah, but if only I
158
could set things right tomorrow, and be born again, and rise again from the
dead! But no--I cannot. Yet I must show her what I can do. Even if she should
do no more than learn that I can still play the man, it would be worth it. Today
it is too late, but TOMORROW...
Yet I have a presentiment that things can never be otherwise. I have got
fifteen louis d’or in my possession, although I began with fifteen gulden. If I
were to play carefully at the start--But no, no! Surely I am not such a fool as
that? Yet WHY should I not rise from the dead? I should require at first but to
go cautiously and patiently and the rest would follow. I should require but to
put a check upon my nature for one hour, and my fortunes would be changed
entirely. Yes, my nature is my weak point. I have only to remember what
happened to me some months ago at Roulettenberg, before my final ruin. What
a notable instance that was of my capacity for resolution! On the occasion in
question I had lost everything--everything; yet, just as I was leaving the
Casino, I heard another gulden give a rattle in my pocket! “Perhaps I shall need
it for a meal,” I thought to myself; but a hundred paces further on, I changed
my mind, and returned. That gulden I staked upon manque--and there is
something in the feeling that, though one is alone, and in a foreign land, and
far from one’s own home and friends, and ignorant of whence one’s next meal
is to come, one is nevertheless staking one’s very last coin! Well, I won the
stake, and in twenty minutes had left the Casino with a hundred and seventy
gulden in my pocket! That is a fact, and it shows what a last remaining gulden
can do. . . . But what if my heart had failed me, or I had shrunk from making
up my mind? . . .
No: tomorrow all shall be ended!

The Idiot
By Fyodor Dostoyevsky
 The Idiot
Part I
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 
I
Towards the end of November, during a thaw, at nine
o’clock one morning, a train on the Warsaw and Petersburg railway was approaching the latter city at full speed.
The morning was so damp and misty that it was only with
great difficulty that the day succeeded in breaking; and it
was impossible to distinguish anything more than a few
yards away from the carriage windows.
Some of the passengers by this particular train were returning from abroad; but the third-class carriages were the
best filled, chiefly with insignificant persons of various occupations and degrees, picked up at the different stations
nearer town. All of them seemed weary, and most of them
had sleepy eyes and a shivering expression, while their complexions generally appeared to have taken on the colour of
the fog outside.
When day dawned, two passengers in one of the thirdclass carriages found themselves opposite each other. Both
were young fellows, both were rather poorly dressed, both
had remarkable faces, and both were evidently anxious to
start a conversation. If they had but known why, at this particular moment, they were both remarkable persons, they
would undoubtedly have wondered at the strange chance
which had set them down opposite to one another in a thirdclass carriage of the Warsaw Railway Company.
 The Idiot
One of them was a young fellow of about twenty-seven,
not tall, with black curling hair, and small, grey, fiery eyes.
His nose was broad and flat, and he had high cheek bones;
his thin lips were constantly compressed into an impudent,
ironical—it might almost be called a malicious—smile; but
his forehead was high and well formed, and atoned for a
good deal of the ugliness of the lower part of his face. A
special feature of this physiognomy was its death-like pallor,
which gave to the whole man an indescribably emaciated
appearance in spite of his hard look, and at the same time
a sort of passionate and suffering expression which did not
harmonize with his impudent, sarcastic smile and keen,
self-satisfied bearing. He wore a large fur—or rather astrachan—overcoat, which had kept him warm all night, while
his neighbour had been obliged to bear the full severity of
a Russian November night entirely unprepared. His wide
sleeveless mantle with a large cape to it—the sort of cloak
one sees upon travellers during the winter months in Switzerland or North Italy—was by no means adapted to the
long cold journey through Russia, from Eydkuhnen to St.
Petersburg.
The wearer of this cloak was a young fellow, also of about
twenty-six or twenty-seven years of age, slightly above the
middle height, very fair, with a thin, pointed and very light
coloured beard; his eyes were large and blue, and had an intent look about them, yet that heavy expression which some
people affirm to be a peculiarity. as well as evidence, of an
epileptic subject. His face was decidedly a pleasant one for
all that; refined, but quite colourless, except for the circum-

stance that at this moment it was blue with cold. He held
a bundle made up of an old faded silk handkerchief that
apparently contained all his travelling wardrobe, and wore
thick shoes and gaiters, his whole appearance being very unRussian.
His black-haired neighbour inspected these peculiarities,
having nothing better to do, and at length remarked, with
that rude enjoyment of the discomforts of others which the
common classes so often show:
‘Cold?’
‘Very,’ said his neighbour, readily. ‘and this is a thaw, too.
Fancy if it had been a hard frost! I never thought it would
be so cold in the old country. I’ve grown quite out of the
way of it.’
‘What, been abroad, I suppose?’
‘Yes, straight from Switzerland.’
‘Wheugh! my goodness!’ The black-haired young fellow
whistled, and then laughed.
The conversation proceeded. The readiness of the fairhaired young man in the cloak to answer all his opposite
neighbour’s questions was surprising. He seemed to have
no suspicion of any impertinence or inappropriateness in
the fact of such questions being put to him. Replying to
them, he made known to the inquirer that he certainly had
been long absent from Russia, more than four years; that
he had been sent abroad for his health; that he had suffered
from some strange nervous malady—a kind of epilepsy,
with convulsive spasms. His interlocutor burst out laughing several times at his answers; and more than ever, when 
 The Idiot
to the question, ‘ whether he had been cured?’ the patient
replied:
‘No, they did not cure me.’
‘Hey! that’s it! You stumped up your money for nothing,
and we believe in those fellows, here!’ remarked the blackhaired individual, sarcastically.
‘Gospel truth, sir, Gospel truth!’ exclaimed another passenger, a shabbily dressed man of about forty, who looked
like a clerk, and possessed a red nose and a very blotchy face.
‘Gospel truth! All they do is to get hold of our good Russian
money free, gratis, and for nothing. ‘
‘Oh, but you’re quite wrong in my particular instance,’
said the Swiss patient, quietly. ‘Of course I can’t argue the
matter, because I know only my own case; but my doctor
gave me money—and he had very little—to pay my journey back, besides having kept me at his own expense, while
there, for nearly two years.’
‘Why? Was there no one else to pay for you?’ asked the
blackhaired one.
‘No—Mr. Pavlicheff, who had been supporting me there,
died a couple of years ago. I wrote to Mrs. General Epanchin
at the time (she is a distant relative of mine), but she did not
answer my letter. And so eventually I came back.’
‘And where have you come to?’
‘That is—where am I going to stay? I—I really don’t quite
know yet, I—‘
Both the listeners laughed again.
‘I suppose your whole set-up is in that bundle, then?’
asked the first.
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 
‘I bet anything it is!’ exclaimed the red-nosed passenger,
with extreme satisfaction, ‘and that he has precious little in
the luggage van!—though of course poverty is no crime—
we must remember that!’
It appeared that it was indeed as they had surmised. The
young fellow hastened to admit the fact with wonderful
readiness.
‘Your bundle has some importance, however,’ continued
the clerk, when they had laughed their fill (it was observable
that the subject of their mirth joined in the laughter when
he saw them laughing); ‘for though I dare say it is not stuffed
full of friedrichs d’or and louis d’or—judge from your costume and gaiters—still—if you can add to your possessions
such a valuable property as a relation like Mrs. General Epanchin, then your bundle becomes a significant object at
once. That is, of course, if you really are a relative of Mrs.
Epanchin’s, and have not made a little error through—well,
absence of mind, which is very common to human beings;
or, say—through a too luxuriant fancy?’
‘Oh, you are right again,’ said the fair-haired traveller,
‘for I really am ALMOST wrong when I say she and I are
related. She is hardly a relation at all; so little, in fact, that I
was not in the least surprised to have no answer to my letter.
I expected as much.’
‘H’m! you spent your postage for nothing, then. H’m!
you are candid, however—and that is commendable. H’m!
Mrs. Epanchin—oh yes! a most eminent person. I know her.
As for Mr. Pavlicheff, who supported you in Switzerland,
I know him too—at least, if it was Nicolai Andreevitch of 
 The Idiot
that name? A fine fellow he was—and had a property of four
thousand souls in his day.’
‘Yes, Nicolai Andreevitch—that was his name,’ and the
young fellow looked earnestly and with curiosity at the allknowing gentleman with the red nose.
This sort of character is met with pretty frequently in a
certain class. They are people who know everyone—that
is, they know where a man is employed, what his salary is,
whom he knows, whom he married, what money his wife
had, who are his cousins, and second cousins, etc., etc.
These men generally have about a hundred pounds a year to
live on, and they spend their whole time and talents in the
amassing of this style of knowledge, which they reduce—or
raise—to the standard of a science.
During the latter part of the conversation the blackhaired young man had become very impatient. He stared
out of the window, and fidgeted, and evidently longed for
the end of the journey. He was very absent; he would appear
to listen-and heard nothing; and he would laugh of a sudden, evidently with no idea of what he was laughing about.
‘Excuse me,’ said the red-nosed man to the young fellow
with the bundle, rather suddenly; ‘whom have I the honour
to be talking to?’
‘Prince Lef Nicolaievitch Muishkin,’ replied the latter,
with perfect readiness.
‘Prince Muishkin? Lef Nicolaievitch? H’m! I don’t know,
I’m sure! I may say I have never heard of such a person,’ said
the clerk, thoughtfully. ‘At least, the name, I admit, is historical. Karamsin must mention the family name, of course, 
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 
in his historybut as an individual—one never hears of any
Prince Muishkin nowadays.’
‘Of course not,’ replied the prince; ‘there are none, except
myself. I believe I am the last and only one. As to my forefathers, they have always been a poor lot; my own father was a
sublieutenant in the army. I don’t know how Mrs. Epanchin
comes into the Muishkin family, but she is descended from
the Princess Muishkin, and she, too, is the last of her line.’
‘And did you learn science and all that, with your professor over there?’ asked the black-haired passenger.
‘Oh yes—I did learn a little, but—‘
‘I’ve never learned anything whatever,’ said the other.
‘Oh, but I learned very little, you know!’ added the prince,
as though excusing himself. ‘They could not teach me very
much on account of my illness. ‘
‘Do you know the Rogojins?’ asked his questioner,
abruptly.
‘No, I don’t—not at all! I hardly know anyone in Russia.
Why, is that your name?’
‘Yes, I am Rogojin, Parfen Rogojin.’
‘Parfen Rogojin? dear me—then don’t you belong to
those very Rogojins, perhaps—‘ began the clerk, with a very
perceptible increase of civility in his tone.
‘Yes—those very ones,’ interrupted Rogojin, impatiently,
and with scant courtesy. I may remark that he had not once
taken any notice of the blotchy-faced passenger, and had
hitherto addressed all his remarks direct to the prince.
‘Dear me—is it possible?’ observed the clerk, while his
face assumed an expression of great deference and servil-
10 The Idiot
ity—if not of absolute alarm: ‘what, a son of that very Semen
Rogojin— hereditary honourable citizen—who died a
month or so ago and left two million and a half of roubles?’
‘And how do YOU know that he left two million and a half
of roubles?’ asked Rogojin, disdainfully, and no deigning so
much as to look at the other. ‘However, it’s true enough that
my father died a month ago, and that here am I returning
from Pskoff, a month after, with hardly a boot to my foot.
They’ve treated me like a dog! I’ve been ill of fever at Pskoff
the whole time, and not a line, nor farthing of money, have I
received from my mother or my confounded brother!’
‘And now you’ll have a million roubles, at least—goodness gracious me!’ exclaimed the clerk, rubbing his hands.
‘Five weeks since, I was just like yourself,’ continued
Rogojin, addressing the prince, ‘with nothing but a bundle
and the clothes I wore. I ran away from my father and came
to Pskoff to my aunt’s house, where I caved in at once with
fever, and he went and died while I was away. All honour to
my respected father’s memory—but he uncommonly nearly
killed me, all the same. Give you my word, prince, if I hadn’t
cut and run then, when I did, he’d have murdered me like
a dog.’
‘I suppose you angered him somehow?’ asked the prince,
looking at the millionaire with considerable curiosity But
though there may have been something remarkable in the
fact that this man was heir to millions of roubles there was
something about him which surprised and interested the
prince more than that. Rogojin, too, seemed to have taken
up the conversation with unusual alacrity it appeared that 
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 11
he was still in a considerable state of excitement, if not absolutely feverish, and was in real need of someone to talk to for
the mere sake of talking, as safety-valve to his agitation.
As for his red-nosed neighbour, the latter—since the information as to the identity of Rogojin—hung over him,
seemed to be living on the honey of his words and in the
breath of his nostrils, catching at every syllable as though it
were a pearl of great price.
‘Oh, yes; I angered him—I certainly did anger him,’ replied Rogojin. ‘But what puts me out so is my brother. Of
course my mother couldn’t do anything—she’s too old—and
whatever brother Senka says is law for her! But why couldn’t
he let me know? He sent a telegram, they say. What’s the
good of a telegram? It frightened my aunt so that she sent it
back to the office unopened, and there it’s been ever since!
It’s only thanks to Konief that I heard at all; he wrote me all
about it. He says my brother cut off the gold tassels from
my father’s coffin, at night because they’re worth a lot of
money!’ says he. Why, I can get him sent off to Siberia for
that alone, if I like; it’s sacrilege. Here, you—scarecrow!’ he
added, addressing the clerk at his side, ‘is it sacrilege or not,
by law?’
‘Sacrilege, certainly—certainly sacrilege,’ said the latter.
‘And it’s Siberia for sacrilege, isn’t it?’
‘Undoubtedly so; Siberia, of course!’
‘They will think that I’m still ill,’ continued Rogojin to
the prince, ‘but I sloped off quietly, seedy as I was, took the
train and came away. Aha, brother Senka, you’ll have to
open your gates and let me in, my boy! I know he told tales 
12 The Idiot
about me to my father—I know that well enough but I certainly did rile my father about Nastasia Philipovna that’s
very sure, and that was my own doing.’
‘Nastasia Philipovna?’ said the clerk, as though trying to
think out something.
‘Come, you know nothing about HER,’ said Rogojin, impatiently.
‘And supposing I do know something?’ observed the other, triumphantly.
‘Bosh! there are plenty of Nastasia Philipovnas. And what
an impertinent beast you are!’ he added angrily. ‘I thought
some creature like you would hang on to me as soon as I got
hold of my money. ‘
‘Oh, but I do know, as it happens,’ said the clerk in an
aggravating manner. ‘Lebedeff knows all about her. You
are pleased to reproach me, your excellency, but what if I
prove that I am right after all? Nastasia Phillpovna’s family
name is Barashkoff—I know, you see-and she is a very well
known lady, indeed, and comes of a good family, too. She
is connected with one Totski, Afanasy Ivanovitch, a man of
considerable property, a director of companies, and so on,
and a great friend of General Epanchin, who is interested in
the same matters as he is.’
‘My eyes!’ said Rogojin, really surprised at last. ‘The devil
take the fellow, how does he know that?’
‘Why, he knows everything—Lebedeff knows everything!
I was a month or two with Lihachof after his father died,
your excellency, and while he was knocking about—he’s in
the debtor’s prison now—I was with him, and he couldn’t 
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 13
do a thing without Lebedeff; and I got to know Nastasia
Philipovna and several people at that time.’
‘Nastasia Philipovna? Why, you don’t mean to say that
she and Lihachof—‘ cried Rogojin, turning quite pale.
‘No, no, no, no, no! Nothing of the sort, I assure you!’ said
Lebedeff, hastily. ‘Oh dear no, not for the world! Totski’s the
only man with any chance there. Oh, no! He takes her to his
box at the opera at the French theatre of an evening, and the
officers and people all look at her and say, ‘By Jove, there’s
the famous Nastasia Philipovna!’ but no one ever gets any
further than that, for there is nothing more to say.’
‘Yes, it’s quite true,’ said Rogojin, frowning gloomily; ‘so
Zaleshoff told me. I was walking about the Nefsky one fine
day, prince, in my father’s old coat, when she suddenly came
out of a shop and stepped into her carriage. I swear I was all
of a blaze at once. Then I met Zaleshoff—looking like a hairdresser’s assistant, got up as fine as I don’t know who, while
I looked like a tinker. ‘Don’t flatter yourself, my boy,’ said
he; ‘she’s not for such as you; she’s a princess, she is, and her
name is Nastasia Philipovna Barashkoff, and she lives with
Totski, who wishes to get rid of her because he’s growing
rather old—fiftyfive or so—and wants to marry a certain
beauty, the loveliest woman in all Petersburg.’ And then he
told me that I could see Nastasia Philipovna at the operahouse that evening, if I liked, and described which was her
box. Well, I’d like to see my father allowing any of us to go
to the theatre; he’d sooner have killed us, any day. However,
I went for an hour or so and saw Nastasia Philipovna, and
I never slept a wink all night after. Next morning my father 
14 The Idiot
happened to give me two government loan bonds to sell,
worth nearly five thousand roubles each. ‘Sell them,’ said
he, ‘and then take seven thousand five hundred roubles to
the office, give them to the cashier, and bring me back the
rest of the ten thousand, without looking in anywhere on
the way; look sharp, I shall be waiting for you.’ Well, I sold
the bonds, but I didn’t take the seven thousand roubles to
the office; I went straight to the English shop and chose a
pair of earrings, with a diamond the size of a nut in each.
They cost four hundred roubles more than I had, so I gave
my name, and they trusted me. With the earrings I went at
once to Zaleshoff’s. ‘Come on!’ I said, ‘come on to Nastasia
Philipovna’s,’ and off we went without more ado. I tell you
I hadn’t a notion of what was about me or before me or below my feet all the way; I saw nothing whatever. We went
straight into her drawing-room, and then she came out to
us.
‘I didn’t say right out who I was, but Zaleshoff said: ‘From
Parfen Rogojin, in memory of his first meeting with you
yesterday; be so kind as to accept these!’
‘She opened the parcel, looked at the earrings, and
laughed.
‘Thank your friend Mr. Rogojin for his kind attention,’
says she, and bowed and went off. Why didn’t I die there
on the spot? The worst of it all was, though, that the beast
Zaleshoff got all the credit of it! I was short and abominably
dressed, and stood and stared in her face and never said a
word, because I was shy, like an ass! And there was he all in
the fashion, pomaded and dressed out, with a smart tie on, 
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 15
bowing and scraping; and I bet anything she took him for
me all the while!
‘Look here now,’ I said, when we came out, ‘none of your
interference here after this-do you understand?’ He laughed:
‘And how are you going to settle up with your father?’ says
he. I thought I might as well jump into the Neva at once
without going home first; but it struck me that I wouldn’t,
after all, and I went home feeling like one of the damned.’
‘My goodness!’ shivered the clerk. ‘And his father,’ he
added, for the prince’s instruction, ‘and his father would
have given a man a ticket to the other world for ten roubles
any day—not to speak of ten thousand!’
The prince observed Rogojin with great curiosity; he
seemed paler than ever at this moment.
‘What do you know about it?’ cried the latter. ‘Well,
my father learned the whole story at once, and Zaleshoff
blabbed it all over the town besides. So he took me upstairs
and locked me up, and swore at me for an hour. ‘This is only
a foretaste,’ says he; ‘wait a bit till night comes, and I’ll come
back and talk to you again.’
‘Well, what do you think? The old fellow went straight off
to Nastasia Philipovna, touched the floor with his forehead,
and began blubbering and beseeching her on his knees to
give him back the diamonds. So after awhile she brought
the box and flew out at him. ‘There,’ she says, ‘take your earrings, you wretched old miser; although they are ten times
dearer than their value to me now that I know what it must
have cost Parfen to get them! Give Parfen my compliments,’
she says, ‘and thank him very much!’ Well, I meanwhile had 
16 The Idiot
borrowed twenty-five roubles from a friend, and off I went
to Pskoff to my aunt’s. The old woman there lectured me so
that I left the house and went on a drinking tour round the
public-houses of the place. I was in a high fever when I got
to Pskoff, and by nightfall I was lying delirious in the streets
somewhere or other!’
‘Oho! we’ll make Nastasia Philipovna sing another song
now!’ giggled Lebedeff, rubbing his hands with glee. ‘Hey,
my boy, we’ll get her some proper earrings now! We’ll get
her such earrings that—‘
‘Look here,’ cried Rogojin, seizing him fiercely by the
arm, ‘look here, if you so much as name Nastasia Philipovna again, I’ll tan your hide as sure as you sit there!’
‘Aha! do—by all means! if you tan my hide you won’t turn
me away from your society. You’ll bind me to you, with your
lash, for ever. Ha, ha! here we are at the station, though.’
Sure enough, the train was just steaming in as he spoke.
Though Rogojin had declared that he left Pskoff secretly,
a large collection of friends had assembled to greet him, and
did so with profuse waving of hats and shouting.
‘Why, there’s Zaleshoff here, too!’ he muttered, gazing at
the scene with a sort of triumphant but unpleasant smile.
Then he suddenly turned to the prince: ‘Prince, I don’t know
why I have taken a fancy to you; perhaps because I met you
just when I did. But no, it can’t be that, for I met this fellow
‘ (nodding at Lebedeff) ‘too, and I have not taken a fancy to
him by any means. Come to see me, prince; we’ll take off
those gaiters of yours and dress you up in a smart fur coat,
the best we can buy. You shall have a dress coat, best quality, 
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 17
white waistcoat, anything you like, and your pocket shall be
full of money. Come, and you shall go with me to Nastasia
Philipovna’s. Now then will you come or no?’
‘Accept, accept, Prince Lef Nicolaievitch’ said Lebedef
solemnly; ‘don’t let it slip! Accept, quick!’
Prince Muishkin rose and stretched out his hand courteously, while he replied with some cordiality:
‘I will come with the greatest pleasure, and thank you
very much for taking a fancy to me. I dare say I may even
come today if I have time, for I tell you frankly that I like you
very much too. I liked you especially when you told us about
the diamond earrings; but I liked you before that as well,
though you have such a dark-clouded sort of face. Thanks
very much for the offer of clothes and a fur coat; I certainly
shall require both clothes and coat very soon. As for money,
I have hardly a copeck about me at this moment.’
‘You shall have lots of money; by the evening I shall have
plenty; so come along!’
‘That’s true enough, he’ll have lots before evening!’ put
in Lebedeff.
‘But, look here, are you a great hand with the ladies? Let’s
know that first?’ asked Rogojin.
‘Oh no, oh no! said the prince; ‘I couldn’t, you know—my
illness—I hardly ever saw a soul.’
‘H’m! well—here, you fellow-you can come along with
me now if you like!’ cried Rogojin to Lebedeff, and so they
all left the carriage.
Lebedeff had his desire. He went off with the noisy group
of Rogojin’s friends towards the Voznesensky, while the 
18 The Idiot
prince’s route lay towards the Litaynaya. It was damp and
wet. The prince asked his way of passers-by, and finding
that he was a couple of miles or so from his destination, he
determined to take a droshky.

General Epanchin lived in his own house near the Litaynaya. Besides this large residence—five-sixths of
which was let in flats and lodgings-the general was owner of another enormous house in the Sadovaya bringing in
even more rent than the first. Besides these houses he had
a delightful little estate just out of town, and some sort of
factory in another part of the city. General Epanchin, as everyone knew, had a good deal to do with certain government
monopolies; he was also a voice, and an important one, in
many rich public companies of various descriptions; in fact,
he enjoyed the reputation of being a wellto-do man of busy
habits, many ties, and affluent means. He had made himself indispensable in several quarters, amongst others in his
department of the government; and yet it was a known fact
that Fedor Ivanovitch Epanchin was a man of no education
whatever, and had absolutely risen from the ranks.
This last fact could, of course, reflect nothing but credit
upon the general; and yet, though unquestionably a sagacious man, he had his own little weaknesses-very excusable
ones,—one of which was a dislike to any allusion to the
above circumstance. He was undoubtedly clever. For instance, he made a point of never asserting himself when he
would gain more by keeping in the background; and in consequence many exalted personages valued him principally 
20 The Idiot
for his humility and simplicity, and because ‘he knew his
place.’ And yet if these good people could only have had a
peep into the mind of this excellent fellow who ‘knew his
place’ so well! The fact is that, in spite of his knowledge of
the world and his really remarkable abilities, he always liked
to appear to be carrying out other people’s ideas rather than
his own. And also, his luck seldom failed him, even at cards,
for which he had a passion that he did not attempt to conceal. He played for high stakes, and moved, altogether, in
very varied society.
As to age, General Epanchin was in the very prime of life;
that is, about fifty-five years of age,—the flowering time of
existence, when real enjoyment of life begins. His healthy
appearance, good colour, sound, though discoloured teeth,
sturdy figure, preoccupied air during business hours, and
jolly good humour during his game at cards in the evening,
all bore witness to his success in life, and combined to make
existence a bed of roses to his excellency. The general was
lord of a flourishing family, consisting of his wife and three
grown-up daughters. He had married young, while still a
lieutenant, his wife being a girl of about his own age, who
possessed neither beauty nor education, and who brought
him no more than fifty souls of landed property, which little
estate served, however, as a nest-egg for far more important
accumulations. The general never regretted his early marriage, or regarded it as a foolish youthful escapade; and he
so respected and feared his wife that he was very near loving
her. Mrs. Epanchin came of the princely stock of Muishkin,
which if not a brilliant, was, at all events, a decidedly an-
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 21
cient family; and she was extremely proud of her descent.
With a few exceptions, the worthy couple had lived
through their long union very happily. While still young the
wife had been able to make important friends among the
aristocracy, partly by virtue of her family descent, and partly by her own exertions; while, in after life, thanks to their
wealth and to the position of her husband in the service, she
took her place among the higher circles as by right.
During these last few years all three of the general’s
daughtersAlexandra, Adelaida, and Aglaya—had grown up
and matured. Of course they were only Epanchins, but their
mother’s family was noble; they might expect considerable
fortunes; their father had hopes of attaining to very high
rank indeed in his country’s service-all of which was satisfactory. All three of the girls were decidedly pretty, even the
eldest, Alexandra, who was just twenty-five years old. The
middle daughter was now twenty-three, while the youngest, Aglaya, was twenty. This youngest girl was absolutely
a beauty, and had begun of late to attract considerable attention in society. But this was not all, for every one of the
three was clever, well educated, and accomplished.
It was a matter of general knowledge that the three girls
were very fond of one another, and supported each other in every way; it was even said that the two elder ones
had made certain sacrifices for the sake of the idol of the
household, Aglaya. In society they not only disliked asserting themselves, but were actually retiring. Certainly no one
could blame them for being too arrogant or haughty, and
yet everybody was well aware that they were proud and 
22 The Idiot
quite understood their own value. The eldest was musical,
while the second was a clever artist, which fact she had concealed until lately. In a word, the world spoke well of the
girls; but they were not without their enemies, and occasionally people talked with horror of the number of books
they had read.
They were in no hurry to marry. They liked good society, but were not too keen about it. All this was the more
remarkable, because everyone was well aware of the hopes
and aims of their parents.
It was about eleven o’clock in the forenoon when the
prince rang the bell at General Epanchin’s door. The general lived on the first floor or flat of the house, as modest a
lodging as his position permitted. A liveried servant opened
the door, and the prince was obliged to enter into long explanations with this gentleman, who, from the first glance,
looked at him and his bundle with grave suspicion. At last,
however, on the repeated positive assurance that he really
was Prince Muishkin, and must absolutely see the general
on business, the bewildered domestic showed him into a
little ante-chamber leading to a waiting-room that adjoined
the general’s study, there handing him over to another servant, whose duty it was to be in this ante-chamber all the
morning, and announce visitors to the general. This second individual wore a dress coat, and was some forty years
of age; he was the general’s special study servant, and well
aware of his own importance.
‘Wait in the next room, please; and leave your bundle
here,’ said the door-keeper, as he sat down comfortably in 
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 23
his own easy-chair in the ante-chamber. He looked at the
prince in severe surprise as the latter settled himself in another chair alongside, with his bundle on his knees.
‘If you don’t mind, I would rather sit here with you,’ said
the prince; ‘I should prefer it to sitting in there.’
‘Oh, but you can’t stay here. You are a visitor—a guest, so
to speak. Is it the general himself you wish to see?’
The man evidently could not take in the idea of such a
shabbylooking visitor, and had decided to ask once more.
‘Yes—I have business—‘ began the prince.
‘I do not ask you what your business may be, all I have to
do is to announce you; and unless the secretary comes in
here I cannot do that.’
The man’s suspicions seemed to increase more and more.
The prince was too unlike the usual run of daily visitors;
and although the general certainly did receive, on business,
all sorts and conditions of men, yet in spite of this fact the
servant felt great doubts on the subject of this particular
visitor. The presence of the secretary as an intermediary
was, he judged, essential in this case.
‘Surely you—are from abroad?’ he inquired at last, in a
confused sort of way. He had begun his sentence intending
to say, ‘Surely you are not Prince Muishkin, are you?’
‘Yes, straight from the train! Did not you intend to say,
‘Surely you are not Prince Muishkin?’ just now, but refrained out of politeness ?’
‘H’m!’ grunted the astonished servant.
‘I assure you I am not deceiving you; you shall not have
to answer for me. As to my being dressed like this, and car-
24 The Idiot
rying a bundle, there’s nothing surprising in that—the fact
is, my circumstances are not particularly rosy at this moment.’
‘H’m!—no, I’m not afraid of that, you see; I have to announce you, that’s all. The secretary will be out directly-that
is, unless you—yes, that’s the rub—unless you—come, you
must allow me to ask you—you’ve not come to beg, have
you?’
‘Oh dear no, you can be perfectly easy on that score. I
have quite another matter on hand.’
‘You must excuse my asking, you know. Your appearance
led me to think—but just wait for the secretary; the general
is busy now, but the secretary is sure to come out.’
‘Oh—well, look here, if I have some time to wait, would
you mind telling me, is there any place about where I could
have a smoke? I have my pipe and tobacco with me.’
‘SMOKE?’ said the man, in shocked but disdainful surprise, blinking his eyes at the prince as though he could not
believe his senses.’ No, sir, you cannot smoke here, and I
wonder you are not ashamed of the very suggestion. Ha, ha!
a cool idea that, I declare!’
‘Oh, I didn’t mean in this room! I know I can’t smoke
here, of course. I’d adjourn to some other room, wherever
you like to show me to. You see, I’m used to smoking a good
deal, and now I haven’t had a puff for three hours; however,
just as you like.’
‘Now how on earth am I to announce a man like that?’
muttered the servant. ‘In the first place, you’ve no right in
here at all; you ought to be in the waiting-room, because 
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 25
you’re a sort of visitor—a guest, in fact—and I shall catch it
for this. Look here, do you intend to take up you abode with
us?’ he added, glancing once more at the prince’s bundle,
which evidently gave him no peace.
‘No, I don’t think so. I don’t think I should stay even if
they were to invite me. I’ve simply come to make their acquaintance, and nothing more.’
‘Make their acquaintance?’ asked the man, in amazement, and with redoubled suspicion. ‘Then why did you say
you had business with the general?’
‘Oh well, very little business. There is one little matter—
some advice I am going to ask him for; but my principal
object is simply to introduce myself, because I am Prince
Muishkin, and Madame Epanchin is the last of her branch
of the house, and besides herself and me there are no other
Muishkins left.’
‘What—you’re a relation then, are you?’ asked the servant, so bewildered that he began to feel quite alarmed.
‘Well, hardly so. If you stretch a point, we are relations,
of course, but so distant that one cannot really take cognizance of it. I once wrote to your mistress from abroad,
but she did not reply. However, I have thought it right to
make acquaintance with her on my arrival. I am telling you
all this in order to ease your mind, for I see you are still
far from comfortable on my account. All you have to do is
to announce me as Prince Muishkin, and the object of my
visit will be plain enough. If I am received—very good; if
not, well, very good again. But they are sure to receive me, I
should think; Madame Epanchin will naturally be curious 
26 The Idiot
to see the only remaining representative of her family. She
values her Muishkin descent very highly, if I am rightly informed.’
The prince’s conversation was artless and confiding to a
degree, and the servant could not help feeling that as from
visitor to common serving-man this state of things was
highly improper. His conclusion was that one of two things
must be the explanation— either that this was a begging
impostor, or that the prince, if prince he were, was simply
a fool, without the slightest ambition; for a sensible prince
with any ambition would certainly not wait about in anterooms with servants, and talk of his own private affairs like
this. In either case, how was he to announce this singular
visitor?
‘I really think I must request you to step into the next
room!’ he said, with all the insistence he could muster.
‘Why? If I had been sitting there now, I should not have
had the opportunity of making these personal explanations.
I see you are still uneasy about me and keep eyeing my cloak
and bundle. Don’t you think you might go in yourself now,
without waiting for the secretary to come out?’
‘No, no! I can’t announce a visitor like yourself without the secretary. Besides the general said he was not to be
disturbed— he is with the Colonel C—. Gavrila Ardalionovitch goes in without announcing.’
‘Who may that be? a clerk?’
‘What? Gavrila Ardalionovitch? Oh no; he belongs to one
of the companies. Look here, at all events put your bundle
down, here.’
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 27
‘Yes, I will if I may; and—can I take off my cloak”
‘Of course; you can’t go in THERE with it on, anyhow.’
The prince rose and took off his mantle, revealing a neat
enough morning costume—a little worn, but well made. He
wore a steel watch chain and from this chain there hung a
silver Geneva watch. Fool the prince might be, still, the general’s servant felt that it was not correct for him to continue
to converse thus with a visitor, in spite of the fact that the
prince pleased him somehow.
‘And what time of day does the lady receive?’ the latter
asked, reseating himself in his old place.
‘Oh, that’s not in my province! I believe she receives at
any time; it depends upon the visitors. The dressmaker goes
in at eleven. Gavrila Ardalionovitch is allowed much earlier
than other people, too; he is even admitted to early lunch
now and then.’
‘It is much warmer in the rooms here than it is abroad at
this season,’ observed the prince; ‘ but it is much warmer
there out of doors. As for the houses—a Russian can’t live in
them in the winter until he gets accustomed to them.’
‘Don’t they heat them at all?’
‘Well, they do heat them a little; but the houses and stoves
are so different to ours.’
‘H’m! were you long away?’
‘Four years! and I was in the same place nearly all the
time,—in one village.’
‘You must have forgotten Russia, hadn’t you?’
‘Yes, indeed I had—a good deal; and, would you believe
it, I often wonder at myself for not having forgotten how to 
28 The Idiot
speak Russian? Even now, as I talk to you, I keep saying to
myself ‘how well I am speaking it.’ Perhaps that is partly
why I am so talkative this morning. I assure you, ever since
yesterday evening I have had the strongest desire to go on
and on talking Russian.’
‘H’m! yes; did you live in Petersburg in former years?’
This good flunkey, in spite of his conscientious scruples,
really could not resist continuing such a very genteel and
agreeable conversation.
‘In Petersburg? Oh no! hardly at all, and now they say so
much is changed in the place that even those who did know
it well are obliged to relearn what they knew. They talk a
good deal about the new law courts, and changes there,
don’t they?’
‘H’m! yes, that’s true enough. Well now, how is the law
over there, do they administer it more justly than here?’
‘Oh, I don’t know about that! I’ve heard much that is good
about our legal administration, too. There is no capital punishment here for one thing.’
‘Is there over there?’
‘Yes—I saw an execution in France—at Lyons. Schneider
took me over with him to see it.’
‘What, did they hang the fellow?’
‘No, they cut off people’s heads in France.’
‘What did the fellow do?—yell?’
‘Oh no—it’s the work of an instant. They put a man inside a frame and a sort of broad knife falls by machinery
-they call the thing a guillotine-it falls with fearful force and
weight-the head springs off so quickly that you can’t wink 
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 29
your eye in between. But all the preparations are so dreadful.
When they announce the sentence, you know, and prepare
the criminal and tie his hands, and cart him off to the scaffold—that’s the fearful part of the business. The people all
crowd round—even womenthough they don’t at all approve
of women looking on.’
‘No, it’s not a thing for women.’
‘Of course not—of course not!—bah! The criminal was
a fine intelligent fearless man; Le Gros was his name; and I
may tell you—believe it or not, as you like—that when that
man stepped upon the scaffold he CRIED, he did indeed,—
he was as white as a bit of paper. Isn’t it a dreadful idea that
he should have cried —cried! Whoever heard of a grown
man crying from fear—not a child, but a man who never
had cried before—a grown man of forty-five years. Imagine
what must have been going on in that man’s mind at such a
moment; what dreadful convulsions his whole spirit must
have endured; it is an outrage on the soul that’s what it is.
Because it is said ‘thou shalt not kill,’ is he to be killed because he murdered some one else? No, it is not right, it’s an
impossible theory. I assure you, I saw the sight a month ago
and it’s dancing before my eyes to this moment. I dream of
it, often.’
The prince had grown animated as he spoke, and a tinge
of colour suffused his pale face, though his way of talking
was as quiet as ever. The servant followed his words with
sympathetic interest. Clearly he was not at all anxious to
bring the conversation to an end. Who knows? Perhaps he
too was a man of imagination and with some capacity for 
30 The Idiot
thought.
‘Well, at all events it is a good thing that there’s no pain
when the poor fellow’s head flies off,’ he remarked.
‘Do you know, though,’ cried the prince warmly, ‘you
made that remark now, and everyone says the same thing,
and the machine is designed with the purpose of avoiding
pain, this guillotine I mean; but a thought came into my
head then: what if it be a bad plan after all? You may laugh
at my idea, perhaps—but I could not help its occurring to
me all the same. Now with the rack and tortures and so
on—you suffer terrible pain of course; but then your torture is bodily pain only (although no doubt you have plenty
of that) until you die. But HERE I should imagine the most
terrible part of the whole punishment is, not the bodily pain
at all—but the certain knowledge that in an hour,—then in
ten minutes, then in half a minute, then now—this very INSTANT—your soul must quit your body and that you will
no longer be a man— and that this is certain, CERTAIN!
That’s the point—the certainty of it. Just that instant when
you place your head on the block and hear the iron grate
over your head—then—that quarter of a second is the most
awful of all.
‘This is not my own fantastical opinion—many people
have thought the same; but I feel it so deeply that I’ll tell you
what I think. I believe that to execute a man for murder is to
punish him immeasurably more dreadfully than is equivalent to his crime. A murder by sentence is far more dreadful
than a murder committed by a criminal. The man who is
attacked by robbers at night, in a dark wood, or anywhere,

undoubtedly hopes and hopes that he may yet escape until
the very moment of his death. There are plenty of instances of a man running away, or imploring for mercy—at all
events hoping on in some degree—even after his throat was
cut. But in the case of an execution, that last hope—having which it is so immeasurably less dreadful to die,—is
taken away from the wretch and CERTAINTY substituted
in its place! There is his sentence, and with it that terrible
certainty that he cannot possibly escape death—which, I
consider, must be the most dreadful anguish in the world.
You may place a soldier before a cannon’s mouth in battle,
and fire upon him—and he will still hope. But read to that
same soldier his death-sentence, and he will either go mad
or burst into tears. Who dares to say that any man can suffer this without going mad? No, no! it is an abuse, a shame,
it is unnecessary—why should such a thing exist? Doubtless there may be men who have been sentenced, who have
suffered this mental anguish for a while and then have been
reprieved; perhaps such men may have been able to relate
their feelings afterwards. Our Lord Christ spoke of this anguish and dread. No! no! no! No man should be treated so,
no man, no man!’
The servant, though of course he could not have expressed all this as the prince did, still clearly entered into
it and was greatly conciliated, as was evident from the increased amiability of his expression. ‘If you are really very
anxious for a smoke,’ he remarked, ‘I think it might possibly be managed, if you are very quick about it. You see
they might come out and inquire for you, and you wouldn’t 
32 The Idiot
be on the spot. You see that door there? Go in there and
you’ll find a little room on the right; you can smoke there,
only open the window, because I ought not to allow it really,
and—.’ But there was no time, after all.
A young fellow entered the ante-room at this moment,
with a bundle of papers in his hand. The footman hastened
to help him take off his overcoat. The new arrival glanced at
the prince out of the corners of his eyes.
‘This gentleman declares, Gavrila Ardalionovitch,’ began
the man, confidentially and almost familiarly, ‘that he is
Prince Muishkin and a relative of Madame Epanchin’s. He
has just arrived from abroad, with nothing but a bundle by
way of luggage—.’
The prince did not hear the rest, because at this point the
servant continued his communication in a whisper.
Gavrila Ardalionovitch listened attentively, and gazed at
the prince with great curiosity. At last he motioned the man
aside and stepped hurriedly towards the prince.
‘Are you Prince Muishkin?’ he asked, with the greatest
courtesy and amiability.
He was a remarkably handsome young fellow of some
twenty-eight summers, fair and of middle height; he wore a
small beard, and his face was most intelligent. Yet his smile,
in spite of its sweetness, was a little thin, if I may so call it,
and showed his teeth too evenly; his gaze though decidedly
good-humoured and ingenuous, was a trifle too inquisitive
and intent to be altogether agreeable.
‘Probably when he is alone he looks quite different, and
hardly smiles at all!’ thought the prince.
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 33
He explained about himself in a few words, very much
the same as he had told the footman and Rogojin beforehand.
Gavrila Ardalionovitch meanwhile seemed to be trying
to recall something.
‘Was it not you, then, who sent a letter a year or less ago—
from Switzerland, I think it was—to Elizabetha Prokofievna
(Mrs. Epanchin)?’
‘It was.’
‘Oh, then, of course they will remember who you are.
You wish to see the general? I’ll tell him at once—he will be
free in a minute; but you—you had better wait in the antechamber,—hadn’t you? Why is he here?’ he added, severely,
to the man.
‘I tell you, sir, he wished it himself!’
At this moment the study door opened, and a military
man, with a portfolio under his arm, came out talking loudly, and after bidding good-bye to someone inside, took his
departure.
‘You there, Gania? cried a voice from the study, ‘come in
here, will you?’
Gavrila Ardalionovitch nodded to the prince and entered the room hastily.
A couple of minutes later the door opened again and the
affable voice of Gania cried:
‘Come in please, prince!’
34 The Idiot
III
General Ivan Fedorovitch Epanchin was standing In the
middle of the room, and gazed with great curiosity at
the prince as he entered. He even advanced a couple of steps
to meet him.
The prince came forward and introduced himself.
‘Quite so,’ replied the general, ‘and what can I do for
you?’
‘Oh, I have no special business; my principal object was
to make your acquaintance. I should not like to disturb you.
I do not know your times and arrangements here, you see,
but I have only just arrived. I came straight from the station.
I am come direct from Switzerland.’
The general very nearly smiled, but thought better of
it and kept his smile back. Then he reflected, blinked his
eyes, stared at his guest once more from head to foot; then
abruptly motioned him to a chair, sat down himself, and
waited with some impatience for the prince to speak.
Gania stood at his table in the far corner of the room,
turning over papers.
‘I have not much time for making acquaintances, as a
rule,’ said the general, ‘but as, of course, you have your object in coming, I—‘
‘I felt sure you would think I had some object in view
when I resolved to pay you this visit,’ the prince interrupt-
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 35
ed; ‘but I give you my word, beyond the pleasure of making
your acquaintance I had no personal object whatever.’
‘The pleasure is, of course, mutual; but life is not all pleasure, as you are aware. There is such a thing as business, and
I really do not see what possible reason there can be, or what
we have in common to—‘
‘Oh, there is no reason, of course, and I suppose there is
nothing in common between us, or very little; for if I am
Prince Muishkin, and your wife happens to be a member of
my house, that can hardly be called a ‘reason.’ I quite understand that. And yet that was my whole motive for coming.
You see I have not been in Russia for four years, and knew
very little about anything when I left. I had been very ill for
a long time, and I feel now the need of a few good friends.
In fact, I have a certain question upon which I much need
advice, and do not know whom to go to for it. I thought of
your family when I was passing through Berlin. ‘They are
almost relations,’ I said to myself,’ so I’ll begin with them;
perhaps we may get on with each other, I with them and
they with me, if they are kind people;’ and I have heard that
you are very kind people!’
‘Oh, thank you, thank you, I’m sure,’ replied the general,
considerably taken aback. ‘May I ask where you have taken
up your quarters?’
‘Nowhere, as yet.’
‘What, straight from the station to my house? And how
about your luggage?’
‘I only had a small bundle, containing linen, with me,
nothing more. I can carry it in my hand, easily. There will 
36 The Idiot
be plenty of time to take a room in some hotel by the evening.’
‘Oh, then you DO intend to take a room?’
‘Of course.’
‘To judge from your words, you came straight to my
house with the intention of staying there.’
‘That could only have been on your invitation. I confess,
however, that I should not have stayed here even if you had
invited me, not for any particular reason, but because it is—
well, contrary to my practice and nature, somehow.’
‘Oh, indeed! Then it is perhaps as well that I neither DID
invite you, nor DO invite you now. Excuse me, prince, but
we had better make this matter clear, once for all. We have
just agreed that with regard to our relationship there is not
much to be said, though, of course, it would have been very
delightful to us to feel that such relationship did actually
exist; therefore, perhaps—‘
‘Therefore, perhaps I had better get up and go away?’ said
the prince, laughing merrily as he rose from his place; just
as merrily as though the circumstances were by no means
strained or difficult. ‘And I give you my word, general, that
though I know nothing whatever of manners and customs
of society, and how people live and all that, yet I felt quite
sure that this visit of mine would end exactly as it has ended
now. Oh, well, I suppose it’s all right; especially as my letter
was not answered. Well, good-bye, and forgive me for having disturbed you!’
The prince’s expression was so good-natured at this
moment, and so entirely free from even a suspicion of un-
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 37
pleasant feeling was the smile with which he looked at the
general as he spoke, that the latter suddenly paused, and appeared to gaze at his guest from quite a new point of view,
all in an instant.
‘Do you know, prince,’ he said, in quite a different tone, ‘I
do not know you at all, yet, and after all, Elizabetha Prokofievna would very likely be pleased to have a peep at a man
of her own name. Wait a little, if you don’t mind, and if you
have time to spare?’
‘Oh, I assure you I’ve lots of time, my time is entirely my
own!’ And the prince immediately replaced his soft, round
hat on the table. ‘I confess, I thought Elizabetha Prokofievna would very likely remember that I had written her
a letter. Just now your servant—outside there—was dreadfully suspicious that I had come to beg of you. I noticed that!
Probably he has very strict instructions on that score; but
I assure you I did not come to beg. I came to make some
friends. But I am rather bothered at having disturbed you;
that’s all I care about.—‘
‘Look here, prince,’ said the general, with a cordial smile,
‘if you really are the sort of man you appear to be, it may
be a source of great pleasure to us to make your better acquaintance; but, you see, I am a very busy man, and have to
be perpetually sitting here and signing papers, or off to see
his excellency, or to my department, or somewhere; so that
though I should be glad to see more of people, nice people—you see, I—however, I am sure you are so well brought
up that you will see at once, and— but how old are you,
prince?’
38 The Idiot
‘Twenty-six.’
‘No? I thought you very much younger.’
‘Yes, they say I have a ‘young’ face. As to disturbing you
I shall soon learn to avoid doing that, for I hate disturbing
people. Besides, you and I are so differently constituted, I
should think, that there must be very little in common between us. Not that I will ever believe there is NOTHING in
common between any two people, as some declare is the
case. I am sure people make a great mistake in sorting each
other into groups, by appearances; but I am boring you, I
see, you—‘
‘Just two words: have you any means at all? Or perhaps
you may be intending to undertake some sort of employment? Excuse my questioning you, but—‘
‘Oh, my dear sir, I esteem and understand your kindness
in putting the question. No; at present I have no means whatever, and no employment either, but I hope to find some. I
was living on other people abroad. Schneider, the professor
who treated me and taught me, too, in Switzerland, gave
me just enough money for my journey, so that now I have
but a few copecks left. There certainly is one question upon
which I am anxious to have advice, but—‘
‘Tell me, how do you intend to live now, and what are
your plans?’ interrupted the general.
‘I wish to work, somehow or other.’
‘Oh yes, but then, you see, you are a philosopher. Have
you any talents, or ability in any direction—that is, any that
would bring in money and bread? Excuse me again—‘
‘Oh, don’t apologize. No, I don’t think I have either tal-
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 39
ents or special abilities of any kind; on the contrary. I have
always been an invalid and unable to learn much. As for
bread, I should think—‘
The general interrupted once more with questions; while
the prince again replied with the narrative we have heard
before. It appeared that the general had known Pavlicheff;
but why the latter had taken an interest in the prince, that
young gentleman could not explain; probably by virtue of
the old friendship with his father, he thought.
The prince had been left an orphan when quite a little
child, and Pavlicheff had entrusted him to an old lady, a
relative of his own, living in the country, the child needing
the fresh air and exercise of country life. He was educated,
first by a governess, and afterwards by a tutor, but could not
remember much about this time of his life. His fits were so
frequent then, that they made almost an idiot of him (the
prince used the expression ‘idiot’ himself). Pavlicheff had
met Professor Schneider in Berlin, and the latter had persuaded him to send the boy to Switzerland, to Schneider’s
establishment there, for the cure of his epilepsy, and, five
years before this time, the prince was sent off. But Pavlicheff had died two or three years since, and Schneider had
himself supported the young fellow, from that day to this, at
his own expense. Although he had not quite cured him, he
had greatly improved his condition; and now, at last, at the
prince’s own desire, and because of a certain matter which
came to the ears of the latter, Schneider had despatched the
young man to Russia.
The general was much astonished.
40 The Idiot
‘Then you have no one, absolutely NO one in Russia?’ he
asked.
‘No one, at present; but I hope to make friends; and then
I have a letter from—‘
‘At all events,’ put in the general, not listening to the
news about the letter, ‘at all events, you must have learned
SOMETHING, and your malady would not prevent your
undertaking some easy work, in one of the departments, for
instance?
‘Oh dear no, oh no! As for a situation, I should much like
to find one for I am anxious to discover what I really am fit
for. I have learned a good deal in the last four years, and, besides, I read a great many Russian books.’
‘Russian books, indeed ? Then, of course, you can read
and write quite correctly?’
‘Oh dear, yes!’
‘Capital! And your handwriting?’
‘Ah, there I am REALLY talented! I may say l am a real
caligraphist. Let me write you something, just to show you,’
said the prince, with some excitement.
‘With pleasure! In fact, it is very necessary. I like your
readiness, prince; in fact, I must say—I-I-like you very well,
altogether,’ said the general.
‘What delightful writing materials you have here, such
a lot of pencils and things, and what beautiful paper! It’s a
charming room altogether. I know that picture, it’s a Swiss
view. I’m sure the artist painted it from nature, and that I
have seen the very place—‘
‘Quite likely, though I bought it here. Gania, give the 
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 41
prince some paper. Here are pens and paper; now then, take
this table. What’s this?’ the general continued to Gania,
who had that moment taken a large photograph out of his
portfolio, and shown it to his senior. ‘Halloa! Nastasia Philipovna! Did she send it you herself? Herself?’ he inquired,
with much curiosity and great animation.
‘She gave it me just now, when I called in to congratulate
her. I asked her for it long ago. I don’t know whether she
meant it for a hint that I had come empty-handed, without
a present for her birthday, or what,’ added Gania, with an
unpleasant smile.
‘Oh, nonsense, nonsense,’ said the general, with decision.
‘ What extraordinary ideas you have, Gania! As if she would
hint; that’s not her way at all. Besides, what could you give
her, without having thousands at your disposal? You might
have given her your portrait, however. Has she ever asked
you for it?’
‘No, not yet. Very likely she never will. I suppose you
haven’t forgotten about tonight, have you, Ivan Fedorovitch? You were one of those specially invited, you know.’
‘Oh no, I remember all right, and I shall go, of course. I
should think so! She’s twenty-five years old today! And, you
know, Gania, you must be ready for great things; she has
promised both myself and Afanasy Ivanovitch that she will
give a decided answer tonight, yes or no. So be prepared!’
Gania suddenly became so ill at ease that his face grew
paler than ever.
‘Are you sure she said that?’ he asked, and his voice
seemed to quiver as he spoke.
42 The Idiot
‘Yes, she promised. We both worried her so that she gave
in; but she wished us to tell you nothing about it until the
day. ‘
The general watched Gania’s confusion intently, and
clearly did not like it.
‘Remember, Ivan Fedorovitch,’ said Gania, in great agitation, ‘that I was to be free too, until her decision; and that
even then I was to have my ‘yes or no’ free.’
‘Why, don’t you, aren’t you—‘ began the general, in
alarm.
‘Oh, don’t misunderstand—‘
‘But, my dear fellow, what are you doing, what do you
mean?’
‘Oh, I’m not rejecting her. I may have expressed myself
badly, but I didn’t mean that.’
‘Reject her! I should think not!’ said the general with annoyance, and apparently not in the least anxious to conceal
it. ‘Why, my dear fellow, it’s not a question of your rejecting
her, it is whether you are prepared to receive her consent
joyfully, and with proper satisfaction. How are things going on at home?’
‘At home? Oh, I can do as I like there, of course; only my
father will make a fool of himself, as usual. He is rapidly becoming a general nuisance. I don’t ever talk to him now, but
I hold him in cheek, safe enough. I swear if it had not been
for my mother, I should have shown him the way out, long
ago. My mother is always crying, of course, and my sister
sulks. I had to tell them at last that I intended to be master
of my own destiny, and that I expect to be obeyed at home. 
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 43
At least, I gave my sister to understand as much, and my
mother was present.’
‘Well, I must say, I cannot understand it!’ said the general, shrugging his shoulders and dropping his hands. ‘You
remember your mother, Nina Alexandrovna, that day she
came and sat here and groaned-and when I asked her what
was the matter, she says, ‘Oh, it’s such a DISHONOUR to
us!’ dishonour! Stuff and nonsense! I should like to know
who can reproach Nastasia Philipovna, or who can say a
word of any kind against her. Did she mean because Nastasia had been living with Totski? What nonsense it is! You
would not let her come near your daughters, says Nina Alexandrovna. What next, I wonder? I don’t see how she can
fail to—to understand—‘
‘Her own position?’ prompted Gania. ‘She does understand. Don’t be annoyed with her. I have warned her not to
meddle in other people’s affairs. However, although there’s
comparative peace at home at present, the storm will break
if anything is finally settled tonight.’
The prince heard the whole of the foregoing conversation, as he sat at the table, writing. He finished at last, and
brought the result of his labour to the general’s desk.
‘So this is Nastasia Philipovna,’ he said, looking attentively and curiously at the portrait. ‘How wonderfully
beautiful!’ he immediately added, with warmth. The picture was certainly that of an unusually lovely woman. She
was photographed in a black silk dress of simple design, her
hair was evidently dark and plainly arranged, her eyes were
deep and thoughtful, the expression of her face passionate, 
44 The Idiot
but proud. She was rather thin, perhaps, and a little pale.
Both Gania and the general gazed at the prince in amazement.
‘How do you know it’s Nastasia Philipovna?’ asked the
general; ‘you surely don’t know her already, do you? ‘
‘Yes, I do! I have only been one day in Russia, but I have
heard of the great beauty!’ And the prince proceeded to
narrate his meeting with Rogojin in the train and the whole
of the latter’s story.
‘There’s news!’ said the general in some excitement, after
listening to the story with engrossed attention.
‘Oh, of course it’s nothing but humbug!’ cried Gania, a
little disturbed, however. ‘It’s all humbug; the young merchant was pleased to indulge in a little innocent recreation!
I have heard something of Rogojin!’
‘Yes, so have I!’ replied the general. ‘Nastasia Philipovna
told us all about the earrings that very day. But now it is
quite a different matter. You see the fellow really has a million of roubles, and he is passionately in love. The whole
story smells of passion, and we all know what this class of
gentry is capable of when infatuated. I am much afraid of
some disagreeable scandal, I am indeed!’
‘You are afraid of the million, I suppose,’ said Gania,
grinning and showing his teeth.
‘And you are NOT, I presume, eh?’
‘How did he strike you, prince?’ asked Gania, suddenly.
‘Did he seem to be a serious sort of a man, or just a common rowdy fellow? What was your own opinion about the
matter?’
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 45
While Gania put this question, a new idea suddenly
flashed into his brain, and blazed out, impatiently, in his
eyes. The general, who was really agitated and disturbed,
looked at the prince too, but did not seem to expect much
from his reply.
‘I really don’t quite know how to tell you,’ replied the
prince, ‘but it certainly did seem to me that the man was
full of passion, and not, perhaps, quite healthy passion. He
seemed to be still far from well. Very likely he will be in bed
again in a day or two, especially if he lives fast.’
‘No! do you think so?’ said the general, catching at the
idea.
‘Yes, I do think so!’
‘Yes, but the sort of scandal I referred to may happen at
any moment. It may be this very evening,’ remarked Gania
to the general, with a smile.
‘Of course; quite so. In that case it all depends upon what
is going on in her brain at this moment.’
‘You know the kind of person she is at times.’
‘How? What kind of person is she?’ cried the general, arrived at the limits of his patience. Look here, Gania, don’t
you go annoying her tonight What you are to do is to be as
agreeable towards her as ever you can. Well, what are you
smiling at? You must understand, Gania, that I have no interest whatever in speaking like this. Whichever way the
question is settled, it will be to my advantage. Nothing will
move Totski from his resolution, so I run no risk. If there is
anything I desire, you must know that it is your benefit only.
Can’t you trust me? You are a sensible fellow, and I have 
46 The Idiot
been counting on you; for, in this matter, that, that—‘
‘Yes, that’s the chief thing,’ said Gania, helping the general out of his difficulties again, and curling his lips in an
envenomed smile, which he did not attempt to conceal. He
gazed with his fevered eyes straight into those of the general, as though he were anxious that the latter might read
his thoughts.
The general grew purple with anger.
‘Yes, of course it is the chief thing!’ he cried, looking
sharply at Gania. ‘What a very curious man you are, Gania!
You actually seem to be GLAD to hear of this millionaire
fellow’s arrivaljust as though you wished for an excuse to
get out of the whole thing. This is an affair in which you
ought to act honestly with both sides, and give due warning,
to avoid compromising others. But, even now, there is still
time. Do you understand me? I wish to know whether you
desire this arrangement or whether you do not? If not, say
so,—and-and welcome! No one is trying to force you into
the snare, Gavrila Ardalionovitch, if you see a snare in the
matter, at least.’
‘I do desire it,’ murmured Gania, softly but firmly, lowering his eyes; and he relapsed into gloomy silence.
The general was satisfied. He had excited himself, and
was evidently now regretting that he had gone so far. He
turned to the prince, and suddenly the disagreeable thought
of the latter’s presence struck him, and the certainty that he
must have heard every word of the conversation. But he felt
at ease in another moment; it only needed one glance at the
prince to see that in that quarter there was nothing to fear.
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 47
‘Oh!’ cried the general, catching sight of the prince’s
specimen of caligraphy, which the latter had now handed
him for inspection. ‘Why, this is simply beautiful; look at
that, Gania, there’s real talent there!’
On a sheet of thick writing-paper the prince had written
in medieval characters the legend:
‘The gentle Abbot Pafnute signed this.’
‘There,’ explained the prince, with great delight and animation, ‘there, that’s the abbot’s real signature—from a
manuscript of the fourteenth century. All these old abbots
and bishops used to write most beautifully, with such taste
and so much care and diligence. Have you no copy of Pogodin, general? If you had one I could show you another type.
Stop a bit—here you have the large round writing common
in France during the eighteenth century. Some of the letters
are shaped quite differently from those now in use. It was the
writing current then, and employed by public writers generally. I copied this from one of them, and you can see how
good it is. Look at the well-rounded a and d. I have tried to
translate the French character into the Russian lettersa difficult thing to do, but I think I have succeeded fairly. Here is
a fine sentence, written in a good, original hand—‘Zeal triumphs over all.’ That is the script of the Russian War Office.
That is how official documents addressed to important personages should be written. The letters are round, the type
black, and the style somewhat remarkable. A stylist would
not allow these ornaments, or attempts at flourishes—just
look at these unfinished tails!—but it has distinction and
really depicts the soul of the writer. He would like to give 
48 The Idiot
play to his imagination, and follow the inspiration of his
genius, but a soldier is only at ease in the guard-room, and
the pen stops half-way, a slave to discipline. How delightful!
The first time I met an example of this handwriting, I was
positively astonished, and where do you think I chanced to
find it? In Switzerland, of all places! Now that is an ordinary
English hand. It can hardly be improved, it is so refined and
exquisite—almost perfection. This is an example of another
kind, a mixture of styles. The copy was given me by a French
commercial traveller. It is founded on the English, but the
downstrokes are a little blacker, and more marked. Notice that the oval has some slight modification—it is more
rounded. This writing allows for flourishes; now a flourish
is a dangerous thing! Its use requires such taste, but, if successful, what a distinction it gives to the whole! It results in
an incomparable type—one to fall in love with!’
‘Dear me! How you have gone into all the refinements
and details of the question! Why, my dear fellow, you are
not a caligraphist, you are an artist! Eh, Gania ?’
‘Wonderful!’ said Gania. ‘And he knows it too,’ he added,
with a sarcastic smile.
‘You may smile,—but there’s a career in this,’ said the
general. ‘You don’t know what a great personage I shall
show this to, prince. Why, you can command a situation
at thirty-five roubles per month to start with. However, it’s
half-past twelve,’ he concluded, looking at his watch; ‘so
to business, prince, for I must be setting to work and shall
not see you again today. Sit down a minute. I have told you
that I cannot receive you myself very often, but I should like 
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 49
to be of some assistance to you, some small assistance, of
a kind that would give you satisfaction. I shall find you a
place in one of the State departments, an easy place—but
you will require to be accurate. Now, as to your plans—in
the house, or rather in the family of Gania here—my young
friend, whom I hope you will know better—his mother and
sister have prepared two or three rooms for lodgers, and
let them to highly recommended young fellows, with board
and attendance. I am sure Nina Alexandrovna will take you
in on my recommendation. There you will be comfortable
and well taken care of; for I do not think, prince, that you
are the sort of man to be left to the mercy of Fate in a town
like Petersburg. Nina Alexandrovna, Gania’s mother, and
Varvara Alexandrovna, are ladies for whom I have the highest possible esteem and respect. Nina Alexandrovna is the
wife of General Ardalion Alexandrovitch, my old brother in
arms, with whom, I regret to say, on account of certain circumstances, I am no longer acquainted. I give you all this
information, prince, in order to make it clear to you that I
am personally recommending you to this family, and that
in so doing, I am more or less taking upon myself to answer
for you. The terms are most reasonable, and I trust that your
salary will very shortly prove amply sufficient for your expenditure. Of course pocket-money is a necessity, if only a
little; do not be angry, prince, if I strongly recommend you
to avoid carrying money in your pocket. But as your purse
is quite empty at the present moment, you must allow me
to press these twenty-five roubles upon your acceptance, as
something to begin with. Of course we will settle this little 
50 The Idiot
matter another time, and if you are the upright, honest man
you look, I anticipate very little trouble between us on that
score. Taking so much interest in you as you may perceive
I do, I am not without my object, and you shall know it in
good time. You see, I am perfectly candid with you. I hope,
Gania, you have nothing to say against the prince’s taking
up his abode in your house?’
‘Oh, on the contrary! my mother will be very glad,’ said
Gania, courteously and kindly.
‘I think only one of your rooms is engaged as yet, is it not?
That fellow Ferd-Ferd—‘
‘Ferdishenko.’
‘Yes—I don’t like that Ferdishenko. I can’t understand
why Nastasia Philipovna encourages him so. Is he really her
cousin, as he says?’
‘Oh dear no, it’s all a joke. No more cousin than I am.’
‘Well, what do you think of the arrangement, prince?’
‘Thank you, general; you have behaved very kindly to me;
all the more so since I did not ask you to help me. I don’t
say that out of pride. I certainly did not know where to lay
my head tonight. Rogojin asked me to come to his house, of
course, but—‘
‘Rogojin? No, no, my good fellow. I should strongly recommend you, paternally,—or, if you prefer it, as a friend,—to
forget all about Rogojin, and, in fact, to stick to the family
into which you are about to enter.’
‘Thank you,’ began the prince; ‘and since you are so very
kind there is just one matter which I—‘
‘You must really excuse me,’ interrupted the general,

‘but I positively haven’t another moment now. I shall just
tell Elizabetha Prokofievna about you, and if she wishes to
receive you at once—as I shall advise her—I strongly recommend you to ingratiate yourself with her at the first
opportunity, for my wife may be of the greatest service to
you in many ways. If she cannot receive you now, you must
be content to wait till another time. Meanwhile you, Gania,
just look over these accounts, will you? We mustn’t forget to
finish off that matter—‘
The general left the room, and the prince never succeeded in broaching the business which he had on hand, though
he had endeavoured to do so four times.
Gania lit a cigarette and offered one to the prince. The
latter accepted the offer, but did not talk, being unwilling to
disturb Gania’s work. He commenced to examine the study
and its contents. But Gania hardly so much as glanced at
the papers lying before him; he was absent and thoughtful, and his smile and general appearance struck the prince
still more disagreeably now that the two were left alone together.
Suddenly Gania approached our hero who was at the
moment standing over Nastasia Philipovna’s portrait, gazing at it.
‘Do you admire that sort of woman, prince?’ he asked,
looking intently at him. He seemed to have some special
object in the question.
‘It’s a wonderful face,’ said the prince, ‘and I feel sure that
her destiny is not by any means an ordinary, uneventful
one. Her face is smiling enough, but she must have suffered 
52 The Idiot
terribly— hasn’t she? Her eyes show it—those two bones
there, the little points under her eyes, just where the cheek
begins. It’s a proud face too, terribly proud! And I—I can’t
say whether she is good and kind, or not. Oh, if she be but
good! That would make all well!’
‘And would you marry a woman like that, now?’ continued Gania, never taking his excited eyes off the prince’s
face.
‘I cannot marry at all,’ said the latter. ‘I am an invalid.’
‘Would Rogojin marry her, do you think?’
‘Why not? Certainly he would, I should think. He would
marry her tomorrow!—marry her tomorrow and murder
her in a week!’
Hardly had the prince uttered the last word when Gania gave such a fearful shudder that the prince almost cried
out.
‘What’s the matter?’ said he, seizing Gania’s hand.
‘Your highness! His excellency begs your presence in her
excellency’s apartments!’ announced the footman, appearing at the door.
The prince immediately followed the man out of the
room.

IV
ALL three of the Miss Epanchins were fine, healthy
girls, wellgrown, with good shoulders and busts, and
strong—almost masculine—hands; and, of course, with
all the above attributes, they enjoyed capital appetites, of
which they were not in the least ashamed.
Elizabetha Prokofievna sometimes informed the girls
that they were a little too candid in this matter, but in spite
of their outward deference to their mother these three young
women, in solemn conclave, had long agreed to modify the
unquestioning obedience which they had been in the habit
of according to her; and Mrs. General Epanchin had judged
it better to say nothing about it, though, of course, she was
well aware of the fact.
It is true that her nature sometimes rebelled against these
dictates of reason, and that she grew yearly more capricious
and impatient; but having a respectful and well-disciplined
husband under her thumb at all times, she found it possible,
as a rule, to empty any little accumulations of spleen upon
his head, and therefore the harmony of the family was kept
duly balanced, and things went as smoothly as family matters can.
Mrs. Epanchin had a fair appetite herself, and generally
took her share of the capital mid-day lunch which was always served for the girls, and which was nearly as good as 
54 The Idiot
a dinner. The young ladies used to have a cup of coffee each
before this meal, at ten o’clock, while still in bed. This was
a favourite and unalterable arrangement with them. At halfpast twelve, the table was laid in the small dining-room,
and occasionally the general himself appeared at the family
gathering, if he had time.
Besides tea and coffee, cheese, honey, butter, pan-cakes
of various kinds (the lady of the house loved these best),
cutlets, and so on, there was generally strong beef soup, and
other substantial delicacies.
On the particular morning on which our story has
opened, the family had assembled in the dining-room, and
were waiting the general’s appearance, the latter having
promised to come this day. If he had been one moment late,
he would have been sent for at once; but he turned up punctually.
As he came forward to wish his wife good-morning and
kiss her hands, as his custom was, he observed something
in her look which boded ill. He thought he knew the reason, and had expected it, but still, he was not altogether
comfortable. His daughters advanced to kiss him, too, and
though they did not look exactly angry, there was something strange in their expression as well.
The general was, owing to certain circumstances, a little
inclined to be too suspicious at home, and needlessly nervous; but, as an experienced father and husband, he judged
it better to take measures at once to protect himself from
any dangers there might be in the air.
However, I hope I shall not interfere with the proper se-
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 55
quence of my narrative too much, if I diverge for a moment
at this point, in order to explain the mutual relations between General Epanchin’s family and others acting a part
in this history, at the time when we take up the thread of
their destiny. I have already stated that the general, though
he was a man of lowly origin, and of poor education, was,
for all that, an experienced and talented husband and father.
Among other things, he considered it undesirable to hurry
his daughters to the matrimonial altar and to worry them
too much with assurances of his paternal wishes for their
happiness, as is the custom among parents of many grownup daughters. He even succeeded in ranging his wife on his
side on this question, though he found the feat very difficult
to accomplish, because unnatural; but the general’s arguments were conclusive, and founded upon obvious facts.
The general considered that the girls’ taste and good sense
should be allowed to develop and mature deliberately, and
that the parents’ duty should merely be to keep watch, in order that no strange or undesirable choice be made; but that
the selection once effected, both father and mother were
bound from that moment to enter heart and soul into the
cause, and to see that the matter progressed without hindrance until the altar should be happily reached.
Besides this, it was clear that the Epanchins’ position
gained each year, with geometrical accuracy, both as to financial solidity and social weight; and, therefore, the longer
the girls waited, the better was their chance of making a
brilliant match.
But again, amidst the incontrovertible facts just recorded, 
56 The Idiot
one more, equally significant, rose up to confront the family; and this was, that the eldest daughter, Alexandra, had
imperceptibly arrived at her twenty-fifth birthday. Almost
at the same moment, Afanasy Ivanovitch Totski, a man of
immense wealth, high connections, and good standing, announced his intention of marrying. Afanasy Ivanovitch was
a gentleman of fifty-five years of age, artistically gifted, and
of most refined tastes. He wished to marry well, and, moreover, he was a keen admirer and judge of beauty.
Now, since Totski had, of late, been upon terms of great
cordiality with Epanchin, which excellent relations were intensified by the fact that they were, so to speak, partners
in several financial enterprises, it so happened that the former now put in a friendly request to the general for counsel
with regard to the important step he meditated. Might he
suggest, for instance, such a thing as a marriage between
himself and one of the general’s daughters?
Evidently the quiet, pleasant current of the family life of
the Epanchins was about to undergo a change.
The undoubted beauty of the family, par excellence,
was the youngest, Aglaya, as aforesaid. But Totski himself,
though an egotist of the extremest type, realized that he
had no chance there; Aglaya was clearly not for such as he.
Perhaps the sisterly love and friendship of the three girls
had more or less exaggerated Aglaya’s chances of happiness.
In their opinion, the latter’s destiny was not merely to be
very happy; she was to live in a heaven on earth. Aglaya’s
husband was to be a compendium of all the virtues, and of
all success, not to speak of fabulous wealth. The two elder 
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 57
sisters had agreed that all was to be sacrificed by them, if
need be, for Aglaya’s sake; her dowry was to be colossal and
unprecedented.
The general and his wife were aware of this agreement,
and, therefore, when Totski suggested himself for one of the
sisters, the parents made no doubt that one of the two elder girls would probably accept the offer, since Totski would
certainly make no difficulty as to dowry. The general valued
the proposal very highly. He knew life, and realized what
such an offer was worth.
The answer of the sisters to the communication was,
if not conclusive, at least consoling and hopeful. It made
known that the eldest, Alexandra, would very likely be disposed to listen to a proposal.
Alexandra was a good-natured girl, though she had a
will of her own. She was intelligent and kind-hearted, and,
if she were to marry Totski, she would make him a good
wife. She did not care for a brilliant marriage; she was eminently a woman calculated to soothe and sweeten the life
of any man; decidedly pretty, if not absolutely handsome.
What better could Totski wish?
So the matter crept slowly forward. The general and
Totski had agreed to avoid any hasty and irrevocable step.
Alexandra’s parents had not even begun to talk to their
daughters freely upon the subject, when suddenly, as it were,
a dissonant chord was struck amid the harmony of the
proceedings. Mrs. Epanchin began to show signs of discontent, and that was a serious matter. A certain circumstance
had crept in, a disagreeable and troublesome factor, which 
58 The Idiot
threatened to overturn the whole business.
This circumstance had come into existence eighteen
years before. Close to an estate of Totski’s, in one of the
central provinces of Russia, there lived, at that time, a poor
gentleman whose estate was of the wretchedest description.
This gentleman was noted in the district for his persistent
ill-fortune; his name was Barashkoff, and, as regards family
and descent, he was vastly superior to Totski, but his estate
was mortgaged to the last acre. One day, when he had ridden over to the town to see a creditor, the chief peasant of
his village followed him shortly after, with the news that his
house had been burnt down, and that his wife had perished
with it, but his children were safe.
Even Barashkoff, inured to the storms of evil fortune
as he was, could not stand this last stroke. He went mad
and died shortly after in the town hospital. His estate was
sold for the creditors; and the little girls—two of them, of
seven and eight years of age respectively,—were adopted by
Totski, who undertook their maintenance and education in
the kindness of his heart. They were brought up together
with the children of his German bailiff. Very soon, however, there was only one of them leftNastasia Philipovna—for
the other little one died of whoopingcough. Totski, who
was living abroad at this time, very soon forgot all about
the child; but five years after, returning to Russia, it struck
him that he would like to look over his estate and see how
matters were going there, and, arrived at his bailiff’s house,
he was not long in discovering that among the children of
the latter there now dwelt a most lovely little girl of twelve, 
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 59
sweet and intelligent, and bright, and promising to develop
beauty of most unusual quality-as to which last Totski was
an undoubted authority.
He only stayed at his country scat a few days on this occasion, but he had time to make his arrangements. Great
changes took place in the child’s education; a good governess was engaged, a Swiss lady of experience and culture. For
four years this lady resided in the house with little Nastia,
and then the education was considered complete. The governess took her departure, and another lady came down to
fetch Nastia, by Totski’s instructions. The child was now
transported to another of Totski’s estates in a distant part
of the country. Here she found a delightful little house, just
built, and prepared for her reception with great care and
taste; and here she took up her abode together with the lady
who had accompanied her from her old home. In the house
there were two experienced maids, musical instruments of
all sorts, a charming ‘young lady’s library,’ pictures, paintboxes, a lapdog, and everything to make life agreeable.
Within a fortnight Totski himself arrived, and from that
time he appeared to have taken a great fancy to this part of
the world and came down each summer, staying two and
three months at a time. So passed four years peacefully and
happily, in charming surroundings.
At the end of that time, and about four months after Totski’s last visit (he had stayed but a fortnight on this occasion),
a report reached Nastasia Philipovna that he was about to
be married in St. Petersburg, to a rich, eminent, and lovely woman. The report was only partially true, the marriage 
60 The Idiot
project being only in an embryo condition; but a great
change now came over Nastasia Philipovna. She suddenly
displayed unusual decision of character; and without wasting time in thought, she left her country home and came up
to St. Petersburg, straight to Totski’s house, all alone.
The latter, amazed at her conduct, began to express his
displeasure; but he very soon became aware that he must
change his voice, style, and everything else, with this young
lady; the good old times were gone. An entirely new and different woman sat before him, between whom and the girl
he had left in the country last July there seemed nothing in
common.
In the first place, this new woman understood a good
deal more than was usual for young people of her age; so
much indeed, that Totski could not help wondering where
she had picked up her knowledge. Surely not from her
‘young lady’s library’? It even embraced legal matters, and
the ‘world’ in general, to a considerable extent.
Her character was absolutely changed. No more of the
girlish alternations of timidity and petulance, the adorable
naivete, the reveries, the tears, the playfulness... It was an
entirely new and hitherto unknown being who now sat and
laughed at him, and informed him to his face that she had
never had the faintest feeling for him of any kind, except
loathing and contempt— contempt which had followed
closely upon her sensations of surprise and bewilderment
after her first acquaintance with him.
This new woman gave him further to understand that
though it was absolutely the same to her whom he married, 
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 61
yet she had decided to prevent this marriage—for no particular reason, but that she chose to do so, and because she
wished to amuse herself at his expense for that it was ‘quite
her turn to laugh a little now!’
Such were her words—very likely she did not give her
real reason for this eccentric conduct; but, at all events, that
was all the explanation she deigned to offer.
Meanwhile, Totski thought the matter over as well as
his scattered ideas would permit. His meditations lasted a
fortnight, however, and at the end of that time his resolution was taken. The fact was, Totski was at that time a man
of fifty years of age; his position was solid and respectable;
his place in society had long been firmly fixed upon safe
foundations; he loved himself, his personal comforts, and
his position better than all the world, as every respectable
gentleman should!
At the same time his grasp of things in general soon
showed Totski that he now had to deal with a being who
was outside the pale of the ordinary rules of traditional
behaviour, and who would not only threaten mischief but
would undoubtedly carry it out, and stop for no one.
There was evidently, he concluded, something at work
here; some storm of the mind, some paroxysm of romantic
anger, goodness knows against whom or what, some insatiable contempt—in a word, something altogether absurd
and impossible, but at the same time most dangerous to be
met with by any respectable person with a position in society to keep up.
For a man of Totski’s wealth and standing, it would, of 
62 The Idiot
course, have been the simplest possible matter to take steps
which would rid him at once from all annoyance; while it
was obviously impossible for Nastasia Philipovna to harm
him in any way, either legally or by stirring up a scandal,
for, in case of the latter danger, he could so easily remove
her to a sphere of safety. However, these arguments would
only hold good in case of Nastasia acting as others might in
such an emergency. She was much more likely to overstep
the bounds of reasonable conduct by some extraordinary
eccentricity.
Here the sound judgment of Totski stood him in good
stead. He realized that Nastasia Philipovna must be well
aware that she could do nothing by legal means to injure
him, and that her flashing eyes betrayed some entirely different intention.
Nastasia Philipovna was quite capable of ruining herself, and even of perpetrating something which would send
her to Siberia, for the mere pleasure of injuring a man for
whom she had developed so inhuman a sense of loathing
and contempt. He had sufficient insight to understand that
she valued nothing in the world—herself least of all—and
he made no attempt to conceal the fact that he was a coward in some respects. For instance, if he had been told that
he would be stabbed at the altar, or publicly insulted, he
would undoubtedly have been frightened; but not so much
at the idea of being murdered, or wounded, or insulted, as
at the thought that if such things were to happen he would
be made to look ridiculous in the eyes of society.
He knew well that Nastasia thoroughly understood him 
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 63
and where to wound him and how, and therefore, as the
marriage was still only in embryo, Totski decided to conciliate her by giving it up. His decision was strengthened by
the fact that Nastasia Philipovna had curiously altered of
late. It would be difficult to conceive how different she was
physically, at the present time, to the girl of a few years ago.
She was pretty then … but now! … Totski laughed angrily
when he thought how short-sighted he had been. In days
gone by he remembered how he had looked at her beautiful
eyes, how even then he had marvelled at their dark mysterious depths, and at their wondering gaze which seemed to
seek an answer to some unknown riddle. Her complexion
also had altered. She was now exceedingly pale, but, curiously, this change only made her more beautiful. Like most
men of the world, Totski had rather despised such a cheaplybought conquest, but of late years he had begun to think
differently about it. It had struck him as long ago as last
spring that he ought to be finding a good match for Nastasia; for instance, some respectable and reasonable young
fellow serving in a government office in another part of the
country. How maliciously Nastasia laughed at the idea of
such a thing, now!
However, it appeared to Totski that he might make use of
her in another way; and he determined to establish her in St.
Petersburg, surrounding her with all the comforts and luxuries that his wealth could command. In this way he might
gain glory in certain circles.
Five years of this Petersburg life went by, and, of course,
during that time a great deal happened. Totski’s position 
64 The Idiot
was very uncomfortable; having ‘funked’ once, he could
not totally regain his ease. He was afraid, he did not know
why, but he was simply afraid of Nastasia Philipovna. For
the first two years or so he had suspected that she wished to
marry him herself, and that only her vanity prevented her
telling him so. He thought that she wanted him to approach
her with a humble proposal from his own side, But to his
great, and not entirely pleasurable amazement, he discovered that this was by no means the case, and that were he
to offer himself he would be refused. He could not understand such a state of things, and was obliged to conclude
that it was pride, the pride of an injured and imaginative
woman, which had gone to such lengths that it preferred
to sit and nurse its contempt and hatred in solitude rather
than mount to heights of hitherto unattainable splendour.
To make matters worse, she was quite impervious to mercenary considerations, and could not be bribed in any way.
Finally, Totski took cunning means to try to break his
chains and be free. He tried to tempt her in various ways
to lose her heart; he invited princes, hussars, secretaries of
embassies, poets, novelists, even Socialists, to see her; but
not one of them all made the faintest impression upon Nastasia. It was as though she had a pebble in place of a heart, as
though her feelings and affections were dried up and withered for ever.
She lived almost entirely alone; she read, she studied, she
loved music. Her principal acquaintances were poor women of various grades, a couple of actresses, and the family
of a poor schoolteacher. Among these people she was much 
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 65
beloved.
She received four or five friends sometimes, of an evening. Totski often came. Lately, too, General Epanchin had
been enabled with great difficulty to introduce himself into
her circle. Gania made her acquaintance also, and others
were Ferdishenko, an illbred, and would-be witty, young
clerk, and Ptitsin, a moneylender of modest and polished
manners, who had risen from poverty. In fact, Nastasia
Philipovna’s beauty became a thing known to all the town;
but not a single man could boast of anything more than his
own admiration for her; and this reputation of hers, and her
wit and culture and grace, all confirmed Totski in the plan
he had now prepared.
And it was at this moment that General Epanchin began
to play so large and important a part in the story.
When Totski had approached the general with his request for friendly counsel as to a marriage with one of his
daughters, he had made a full and candid confession. He had
said that he intended to stop at no means to obtain his freedom; even if Nastasia were to promise to leave him entirely
alone in future, he would not (he said) believe and trust her;
words were not enough for him; he must have solid guarantees of some sort. So he and the general determined to try
what an attempt to appeal to her heart would effect. Having
arrived at Nastasia’s house one day, with Epanchin, Totski
immediately began to speak of the intolerable torment of
his position. He admitted that he was to blame for all, but
candidly confessed that he could not bring himself to feel
any remorse for his original guilt towards herself, because 
66 The Idiot
he was a man of sensual passions which were inborn and
ineradicable, and that he had no power over himself in this
respect; but that he wished, seriously, to marry at last, and
that the whole fate of the most desirable social union which
he contemplated, was in her hands; in a word, he confided
his all to her generosity of heart.
General Epanchin took up his part and spoke in the
character of father of a family; he spoke sensibly, and without wasting words over any attempt at sentimentality, he
merely recorded his full admission of her right to be the
arbiter of Totski’s destiny at this moment. He then pointed
out that the fate of his daughter, and very likely of both his
other daughters, now hung upon her reply.
To Nastasia’s question as to what they wished her to do,
Totski confessed that he had been so frightened by her, five
years ago, that he could never now be entirely comfortable
until she herself married. He immediately added that such
a suggestion from him would, of course, be absurd, unless
accompanied by remarks of a more pointed nature. He very
well knew, he said, that a certain young gentleman of good
family, namely, Gavrila Ardalionovitch Ivolgin, with whom
she was acquainted, and whom she received at her house,
had long loved her passionately, and would give his life for
some response from her. The young fellow had confessed
this love of his to him (Totski) and had also admitted it in
the hearing of his benefactor, General Epanchin. Lastly, he
could not help being of opinion that Nastasia must be aware
of Gania’s love for her, and if he (Totski) mistook not, she
had looked with some favour upon it, being often lonely, 
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 67
and rather tired of her present life. Having remarked how
difficult it was for him, of all people, to speak to her of these
matters, Totski concluded by saying that he trusted Nastasia Philipovna would not look with contempt upon him if
he now expressed his sincere desire to guarantee her future
by a gift of seventy-five thousand roubles. He added that
the sum would have been left her all the same in his will,
and that therefore she must not consider the gift as in any
way an indemnification to her for anything, but that there
was no reason, after all, why a man should not be allowed
to entertain a natural desire to lighten his conscience, etc.,
etc.; in fact, all that would naturally be said under the circumstances. Totski was very eloquent all through, and, in
conclusion, just touched on the fact that not a soul in the
world, not even General Epanchin, had ever heard a word
about the above seventy-five thousand roubles, and that
this was the first time he had ever given expression to his
intentions in respect to them.
Nastasia Philipovna’s reply to this long rigmarole astonished both the friends considerably.
Not only was there no trace of her former irony, of her
old hatred and enmity, and of that dreadful laughter, the
very recollection of which sent a cold chill down Totski’s
back to this very day; but she seemed charmed and really
glad to have the opportunity of talking seriously with him
for once in a way. She confessed that she had long wished
to have a frank and free conversation and to ask for friendly advice, but that pride had hitherto prevented her; now,
however, that the ice was broken, nothing could be more 
68 The Idiot
welcome to her than this opportunity.
First, with a sad smile, and then with a twinkle of merriment in her eyes, she admitted that such a storm as that
of five years ago was now quite out of the question. She said
that she had long since changed her views of things, and
recognized that facts must be taken into consideration in
spite of the feelings of the heart. What was done was done
and ended, and she could not understand why Totski should
still feel alarmed.
She next turned to General Epanchin and observed, most
courteously, that she had long since known of his daughters,
and that she had heard none but good report; that she had
learned to think of them with deep and sincere respect. The
idea alone that she could in any way serve them, would be to
her both a pride and a source of real happiness.
It was true that she was lonely in her present life; Totski
had judged her thoughts aright. She longed to rise, if not to
love, at least to family life and new hopes and objects, but
as to Gavrila Ardalionovitch, she could not as yet say much.
She thought it must be the case that he loved her; she felt
that she too might learn to love him, if she could be sure of
the firmness of his attachment to herself; but he was very
young, and it was a difficult question to decide. What she
specially liked about him was that he worked, and supported his family by his toil.
She had heard that he was proud and ambitious; she had
heard much that was interesting of his mother and sister,
she had heard of them from Mr. Ptitsin, and would much
like to make their acquaintance, but—another question!—
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 69
would they like to receive her into their house? At all events,
though she did not reject the idea of this marriage, she desired not to be hurried. As for the seventy-five thousand
roubles, Mr. Totski need not have found any difficulty or
awkwardness about the matter; she quite understood the
value of money, and would, of course, accept the gift. She
thanked him for his delicacy, however, but saw no reason
why Gavrila Ardalionovitch should not know about it.
She would not marry the latter, she said, until she felt
persuaded that neither on his part nor on the part of his
family did there exist any sort of concealed suspicions as to
herself. She did not intend to ask forgiveness for anything
in the past, which fact she desired to be known. She did not
consider herself to blame for anything that had happened in
former years, and she thought that Gavrila Ardalionovitch
should be informed as to the relations which had existed
between herself and Totski during the last five years. If she
accepted this money it was not to be considered as indemnification for her misfortune as a young girl, which had not
been in any degree her own fault, but merely as compensation for her ruined life.
She became so excited and agitated during all these explanations and confessions that General Epanchin was
highly gratified, and considered the matter satisfactorily arranged once for all. But the once bitten Totski was
twice shy, and looked for hidden snakes among the flowers.
However, the special point to which the two friends particularly trusted to bring about their object (namely, Gania’s
attractiveness for Nastasia Philipovna), stood out more and 
70 The Idiot
more prominently; the pourparlers had commenced, and
gradually even Totski began to believe in the possibility of
success.
Before long Nastasia and Gania had talked the matter
over. Very little was said—her modesty seemed to suffer
under the infliction of discussing such a question. But she
recognized his love, on the understanding that she bound
herself to nothing whatever, and that she reserved the right
to say ‘no’ up to the very hour of the marriage ceremony.
Gania was to have the same right of refusal at the last moment.
It soon became clear to Gania, after scenes of wrath and
quarrellings at the domestic hearth, that his family were seriously opposed to the match, and that Nastasia was aware
of this fact was equally evident. She said nothing about it,
though he daily expected her to do so.
There were several rumours afloat, before long, which
upset Totski’s equanimity a good deal, but we will not now
stop to describe them; merely mentioning an instance or
two. One was that Nastasia had entered into close and secret
relations with the Epanchin girls—a most unlikely rumour;
another was that Nastasia had long satisfied herself of the
fact that Gania was merely marrying her for money, and
that his nature was gloomy and greedy, impatient and selfish, to an extraordinary degree; and that although he had
been keen enough in his desire to achieve a conquest before,
yet since the two friends had agreed to exploit his passion for
their own purposes, it was clear enough that he had begun
to consider the whole thing a nuisance and a nightmare.

In his heart passion and hate seemed to hold divided
sway, and although he had at last given his consent to marry
the woman (as he said), under the stress of circumstances,
yet he promised himself that he would ‘take it out of her,’
after marriage.
Nastasia seemed to Totski to have divined all this, and
to be preparing something on her own account, which
frightened him to such an extent that he did not dare communicate his views even to the general. But at times he
would pluck up his courage and be full of hope and good
spirits again, acting, in fact, as weak men do act in such circumstances.
However, both the friends felt that the thing looked rosy
indeed when one day Nastasia informed them that she
would give her final answer on the evening of her birthday,
which anniversary was due in a very short time.
A strange rumour began to circulate, meanwhile; no less
than that the respectable and highly respected General Epanchin was himself so fascinated by Nastasia Philipovna
that his feeling for her amounted almost to passion. What
he thought to gain by Gania’s marriage to the girl it was
difficult to imagine. Possibly he counted on Gania’s complaisance; for Totski had long suspected that there existed
some secret understanding between the general and his
secretary. At all events the fact was known that he had prepared a magnificent present of pearls for Nastasia’s birthday,
and that he was looking forward to the occasion when he
should present his gift with the greatest excitement and impatience. The day before her birthday he was in a fever of 
72 The Idiot
agitation.
Mrs. Epanchin, long accustomed to her husband’s infidelities, had heard of the pearls, and the rumour excited her
liveliest curiosity and interest. The general remarked her
suspicions, and felt that a grand explanation must shortly
take place—which fact alarmed him much.
This is the reason why he was so unwilling to take lunch
(on the morning upon which we took up this narrative)
with the rest of his family. Before the prince’s arrival he
had made up his mind to plead business, and ‘cut’ the meal;
which simply meant running away.
He was particularly anxious that this one day should be
passed— especially the evening—without unpleasantness
between himself and his family; and just at the right moment the prince turned up—‘as though Heaven had sent
him on purpose,’ said the general to himself, as he left the
study to seek out the wife of his bosom.

Mrs. General Epanchin was a proud woman by nature.
What must her feelings have been when she heard that
Prince Muishkin, the last of his and her line, had arrived in
beggar’s guise, a wretched idiot, a recipient of charity—all
of which details the general gave out for greater effect! He
was anxious to steal her interest at the first swoop, so as to
distract her thoughts from other matters nearer home.
Mrs. Epanchin was in the habit of holding herself very
straight, and staring before her, without speaking, in moments of excitement.
She was a fine woman of the same age as her husband,
with a slightly hooked nose, a high, narrow forehead, thick
hair turning a little grey, and a sallow complexion. Her eyes
were grey and wore a very curious expression at times. She
believed them to be most effective—a belief that nothing
could alter.
‘What, receive him! Now, at once?’ asked Mrs. Epanchin,
gazing vaguely at her husband as he stood fidgeting before
her.
‘Oh, dear me, I assure you there is no need to stand on
ceremony with him,’ the general explained hastily. ‘He is
quite a child, not to say a pathetic-looking creature. He
has fits of some sort, and has just arrived from Switzerland,
straight from the station, dressed like a German and with-
74 The Idiot
out a farthing in his pocket. I gave him twenty-five roubles
to go on with, and am going to find him some easy place in
one of the government offices. I should like you to ply him
well with the victuals, my dears, for I should think he must
be very hungry.’
‘You astonish me,’ said the lady, gazing as before. ‘Fits,
and hungry too! What sort of fits?’
‘Oh, they don’t come on frequently, besides, he’s a regular
child, though he seems to be fairly educated. I should like
you, if possible, my dears,’ the general added, making slowly for the door, ‘to put him through his paces a bit, and see
what he is good for. I think you should be kind to him; it is a
good deed, you know—however, just as you like, of course—
but he is a sort of relation, remember, and I thought it might
interest you to see the young fellow, seeing that this is so.’
‘Oh, of course, mamma, if we needn’t stand on ceremony
with him, we must give the poor fellow something to eat after his journey; especially as he has not the least idea where
to go to,’ said Alexandra, the eldest of the girls.
‘Besides, he’s quite a child; we can entertain him with a
little hide-and-seek, in case of need,’ said Adelaida.
‘Hide-and-seek? What do you mean?’ inquired Mrs. Epanchin.
‘Oh, do stop pretending, mamma,’ cried Aglaya, in vexation. ‘Send him up, father; mother allows.’
The general rang the bell and gave orders that the prince
should be shown in.
‘Only on condition that he has a napkin under his chin
at lunch, then,’ said Mrs. Epanchin, ‘and let Fedor, or Ma-
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 75
vra, stand behind him while he eats. Is he quiet when he has
these fits? He doesn’t show violence, does he?’
‘On the contrary, he seems to be very well brought up.
His manners are excellent—but here he is himself. Here you
are, prince—let me introduce you, the last of the Muishkins,
a relative of your own, my dear, or at least of the same name.
Receive him kindly, please. They’ll bring in lunch directly,
prince; you must stop and have some, but you must excuse
me. I’m in a hurry, I must be off—‘
‘We all know where YOU must be off to!’ said Mrs. Epanchin, in a meaning voice.
‘Yes, yes—I must hurry away, I’m late! Look here, dears,
let him write you something in your albums; you’ve no idea
what a wonderful caligraphist he is, wonderful talent! He
has just written out ‘Abbot Pafnute signed this’ for me. Well,
au revoir!’
‘Stop a minute; where are you off to? Who is this abbot?’
cried Mrs. Epanchin to her retreating husband in a tone of
excited annoyance.
‘Yes, my dear, it was an old abbot of that name-I must be
off to see the count, he’s waiting for me, I’m late—Good-bye!
Au revoir, prince!’—and the general bolted at full speed.
‘Oh, yes—I know what count you’re going to see!’ remarked his wife in a cutting manner, as she turned her
angry eyes on the prince. ‘Now then, what’s all this about?—
What abbot—Who’s Pafnute?’ she added, brusquely.
‘Mamma!’ said Alexandra, shocked at her rudeness.
Aglaya stamped her foot.
‘Nonsense! Let me alone!’ said the angry mother. ‘Now 
76 The Idiot
then, prince, sit down here, no, nearer, come nearer the
light! I want to have a good look at you. So, now then, who
is this abbot?’
‘Abbot Pafnute,’ said our friend, seriously and with deference.
‘Pafnute, yes. And who was he?’
Mrs. Epanchin put these questions hastily and brusquely,
and when the prince answered she nodded her head sagely
at each word he said.
‘The Abbot Pafnute lived in the fourteenth century,’ began the prince; ‘he was in charge of one of the monasteries
on the Volga, about where our present Kostroma government lies. He went to Oreol and helped in the great matters
then going on in the religious world; he signed an edict
there, and I have seen a print of his signature; it struck me,
so I copied it. When the general asked me, in his study, to
write something for him, to show my handwriting, I wrote
‘The Abbot Pafnute signed this,’ in the exact handwriting of
the abbot. The general liked it very much, and that’s why he
recalled it just now. ‘
‘Aglaya, make a note of ‘Pafnute,’ or we shall forget him.
H’m! and where is this signature?’
‘I think it was left on the general’s table.’
‘Let it be sent for at once!’
‘Oh, I’ll write you a new one in half a minute,’ said the
prince, ‘if you like!’
‘Of course, mamma!’ said Alexandra. ‘But let’s have
lunch now, we are all hungry!’
‘Yes; come along, prince,’ said the mother, ‘are you very 
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 77
hungry?’
‘Yes; I must say that I am pretty hungry, thanks very
much.’
‘H’m! I like to see that you know your manners; and you
are by no means such a person as the general thought fit to
describe you. Come along; you sit here, opposite to me,’ she
continued, ‘I wish to be able to see your face. Alexandra,
Adelaida, look after the prince! He doesn’t seem so very ill,
does he? I don’t think he requires a napkin under his chin,
after all; are you accustomed to having one on, prince?’
‘Formerly, when I was seven years old or so. I believe I
wore one; but now I usually hold my napkin on my knee
when I eat.’
‘Of course, of course! And about your fits?’
‘Fits?’ asked the prince, slightly surprised. ‘I very seldom have fits nowadays. I don’t know how it may be here,
though; they say the climate may be bad for me. ‘
‘He talks very well, you know!’ said Mrs. Epanchin, who
still continued to nod at each word the prince spoke. ‘I
really did not expect it at all; in fact, I suppose it was all
stuff and nonsense on the general’s part, as usual. Eat away,
prince, and tell me where you were born, and where you
were brought up. I wish to know all about you, you interest
me very much!’
The prince expressed his thanks once more, and eating heartily the while, recommenced the narrative of his
life in Switzerland, all of which we have heard before. Mrs.
Epanchin became more and more pleased with her guest;
the girls, too, listened with considerable attention. In talk-
78 The Idiot
ing over the question of relationship it turned out that the
prince was very well up in the matter and knew his pedigree
off by heart. It was found that scarcely any connection existed between himself and Mrs. Epanchin, but the talk, and
the opportunity of conversing about her family tree, gratified the latter exceedingly, and she rose from the table in
great good humour.
‘Let’s all go to my boudoir,’ she said, ‘and they shall bring
some coffee in there. That’s the room where we all assemble
and busy ourselves as we like best,’ she explained. ‘Alexandra, my eldest, here, plays the piano, or reads or sews;
Adelaida paints landscapes and portraits (but never finishes any); and Aglaya sits and does nothing. I don’t work too
much, either. Here we are, now; sit down, prince, near the
fire and talk to us. I want to hear you relate something. I
wish to make sure of you first and then tell my old friend,
Princess Bielokonski, about you. I wish you to know all the
good people and to interest them. Now then, begin!’
‘Mamma, it’s rather a strange order, that!’ said Adelaida,
who was fussing among her paints and paint-brushes at the
easel. Aglaya and Alexandra had settled themselves with
folded hands on a sofa, evidently meaning to be listeners.
The prince felt that the general attention was concentrated
upon himself.
‘I should refuse to say a word if I were ordered to tell a
story like that!’ observed Aglaya.
‘Why? what’s there strange about it? He has a tongue.
Why shouldn’t he tell us something? I want to judge whether he is a good story-teller; anything you like, prince-how 
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 79
you liked Switzerland, what was your first impression, anything. You’ll see, he’ll begin directly and tell us all about it
beautifully.’
‘The impression was forcible—‘ the prince began.
‘There, you see, girls,’ said the impatient lady, ‘he has begun, you see.’
‘Well, then, LET him talk, mamma,’ said Alexandra.
‘This prince is a great humbug and by no means an idiot,’
she whispered to Aglaya.
‘Oh, I saw that at once,’ replied the latter. ‘I don’t think it
at all nice of him to play a part. What does he wish to gain
by it, I wonder?’
‘My first impression was a very strong one,’ repeated the
prince. ‘When they took me away from Russia, I remember
I passed through many German towns and looked out of
the windows, but did not trouble so much as to ask questions about them. This was after a long series of fits. I always
used to fall into a sort of torpid condition after such a series,
and lost my memory almost entirely; and though I was not
altogether without reason at such times, yet I had no logical power of thought. This would continue for three or four
days, and then I would recover myself again. I remember my
melancholy was intolerable; I felt inclined to cry; I sat and
wondered and wondered uncomfortably; the consciousness
that everything was strange weighed terribly upon me; I
could understand that it was all foreign and strange. I recollect I awoke from this state for the first time at Basle, one
evening; the bray of a donkey aroused me, a donkey in the
town market. I saw the donkey and was extremely pleased 
80 The Idiot
with it, and from that moment my head seemed to clear.’
‘A donkey? How strange! Yet it is not strange. Anyone of
us might fall in love with a donkey! It happened in mythological times,’ said Madame Epanchin, looking wrathfully
at her daughters, who had begun to laugh. ‘Go on, prince.’
‘Since that evening I have been specially fond of donkeys.
I began to ask questions about them, for I had never seen
one before; and I at once came to the conclusion that this
must be one of the most useful of animals—strong, willing,
patient, cheap; and, thanks to this donkey, I began to like
the whole country I was travelling through; and my melancholy passed away.’
‘All this is very strange and interesting,’ said Mrs. Epanchin. ‘Now let’s leave the donkey and go on to other
matters. What are you laughing at, Aglaya? and you too,
Adelaida? The prince told us his experiences very cleverly;
he saw the donkey himself, and what have you ever seen?
YOU have never been abroad.’
‘I have seen a donkey though, mamma!’ said Aglaya.
‘And I’ve heard one!’ said Adelaida. All three of the girls
laughed out loud, and the prince laughed with them.
‘Well, it’s too bad of you,’ said mamma. ‘You must forgive
them, prince; they are good girls. I am very fond of them,
though I often have to be scolding them; they are all as silly
and mad as march hares.’
‘Oh, why shouldn’t they laugh?’ said the prince. ‘ I
shouldn’t have let the chance go by in their place, I know.
But I stick up for the donkey, all the same; he’s a patient,
good-natured fellow.’
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 81
‘Are you a patient man, prince? I ask out of curiosity,’ said
Mrs. Epanchin.
All laughed again.
‘Oh, that wretched donkey again, I see!’ cried the lady. ‘I
assure you, prince, I was not guilty of the least—‘
‘Insinuation? Oh! I assure you, I take your word for it.’
And the prince continued laughing merrily.
‘I must say it’s very nice of you to laugh. I see you really
are a kind-hearted fellow,’ said Mrs. Epanchin.
‘I’m not always kind, though.’
‘I am kind myself, and ALWAYS kind too, if you please!’
she retorted, unexpectedly; ‘and that is my chief fault, for
one ought not to be always kind. I am often angry with
these girls and their father; but the worst of it is, I am always
kindest when I am cross. I was very angry just before you
came, and Aglaya there read me a lesson—thanks, Aglaya,
dear—come and kiss me—there—that’s enough’ she added,
as Aglaya came forward and kissed her lips and then her
hand. ‘Now then, go on, prince. Perhaps you can think of
something more exciting than about the donkey, eh?’
‘I must say, again, I can’t understand how you can expect
anyone to tell you stories straight away, so,’ said Adelaida. ‘I
know I never could!’
‘Yes, but the prince can, because he is clever—cleverer
than you are by ten or twenty times, if you like. There, that’s
so, prince; and seriously, let’s drop the donkey now—what
else did you see abroad, besides the donkey?’
‘Yes, but the prince told us about the donkey very cleverly,
all the same,’ said Alexandra. ‘I have always been most in-
82 The Idiot
terested to hear how people go mad and get well again, and
that sort of thing. Especially when it happens suddenly.’
‘Quite so, quite so!’ cried Mrs. Epanchin, delighted. ‘I see
you CAN be sensible now and then, Alexandra. You were
speaking of Switzerland, prince?’
‘Yes. We came to Lucerne, and I was taken out in a boat.
I felt how lovely it was, but the loveliness weighed upon me
somehow or other, and made me feel melancholy.’
‘Why?’ asked Alexandra.
‘I don’t know; I always feel like that when I look at the
beauties of nature for the first time; but then, I was ill at that
time, of course!’
‘Oh, but I should like to see it!’ said Adelaida; ‘and I don’t
know WHEN we shall ever go abroad. I’ve been two years
looking out for a good subject for a picture. I’ve done all I
know. ‘The North and South I know by heart,’ as our poet
observes. Do help me to a subject, prince.’
‘Oh, but I know nothing about painting. It seems to me
one only has to look, and paint what one sees.’
‘But I don’t know HOW to see!’
‘Nonsense, what rubbish you talk!’ the mother struck in.
‘Not know how to see! Open your eyes and look! If you can’t
see here, you won’t see abroad either. Tell us what you saw
yourself, prince!’
‘Yes, that’s better,’ said Adelaida; ‘the prince learned to
see abroad.’
‘Oh, I hardly know! You see, I only went to restore my
health. I don’t know whether I learned to see, exactly. I was
very happy, however, nearly all the time.’
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 83
‘Happy! you can be happy?’ cried Aglaya. ‘Then how can
you say you did not learn to see? I should think you could
teach us to see!’
‘Oh! DO teach us,’ laughed Adelaida.
‘Oh! I can’t do that,’ said the prince, laughing too. ‘I lived
almost all the while in one little Swiss village; what can I
teach you? At first I was only just not absolutely dull; then
my health began to improve—then every day became dearer and more precious to me, and the longer I stayed, the
dearer became the time to me; so much so that I could not
help observing it; but why this was so, it would be difficult
to say.’
‘So that you didn’t care to go away anywhere else?’
‘Well, at first I did; I was restless; I didn’t know however
I should manage to support life—you know there are such
moments, especially in solitude. There was a waterfall near
us, such a lovely thin streak of water, like a thread but white
and moving. It fell from a great height, but it looked quite
low, and it was half a mile away, though it did not seem
fifty paces. I loved to listen to it at night, but it was then
that I became so restless. Sometimes I went and climbed
the mountain and stood there in the midst of the tall pines,
all alone in the terrible silence, with our little village in the
distance, and the sky so blue, and the sun so bright, and
an old ruined castle on the mountain-side, far away. I used
to watch the line where earth and sky met, and longed to
go and seek there the key of all mysteries, thinking that I
might find there a new life, perhaps some great city where
life should be grander and richer—and then it struck me 
84 The Idiot
that life may be grand enough even in a prison.’
‘I read that last most praiseworthy thought in my manual,
when I was twelve years old,’ said Aglaya.
‘All this is pure philosophy,’ said Adelaida. ‘You are a philosopher, prince, and have come here to instruct us in your
views.’
‘Perhaps you are right,’ said the prince, smiling. ‘I think
I am a philosopher, perhaps, and who knows, perhaps I do
wish to teach my views of things to those I meet with?’
‘Your philosophy is rather like that of an old woman we
know, who is rich and yet does nothing but try how little
she can spend. She talks of nothing but money all day. Your
great philosophical idea of a grand life in a prison and your
four happy years in that Swiss village are like this, rather,’
said Aglaya.
‘As to life in a prison, of course there may be two opinions,’ said the prince. ‘I once heard the story of a man who
lived twelve years in a prison—I heard it from the man himself. He was one of the persons under treatment with my
professor; he had fits, and attacks of melancholy, then he
would weep, and once he tried to commit suicide. HIS life
in prison was sad enough; his only acquaintances were spiders and a tree that grew outside his grating-but I think I
had better tell you of another man I met last year. There
was a very strange feature in this case, strange because of
its extremely rare occurrence. This man had once been
brought to the scaffold in company with several others, and
had had the sentence of death by shooting passed upon him
for some political crime. Twenty minutes later he had been 
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 85
reprieved and some other punishment substituted; but the
interval between the two sentences, twenty minutes, or at
least a quarter of an hour, had been passed in the certainty
that within a few minutes he must die. I was very anxious
to hear him speak of his impressions during that dreadful time, and I several times inquired of him as to what he
thought and felt. He remembered everything with the most
accurate and extraordinary distinctness, and declared that
he would never forget a single iota of the experience.
‘About twenty paces from the scaffold, where he had
stood to hear the sentence, were three posts, fixed in the
ground, to which to fasten the criminals (of whom there
were several). The first three criminals were taken to the
posts, dressed in long white tunics, with white caps drawn
over their faces, so that they could not see the rifles pointed
at them. Then a group of soldiers took their stand opposite to each post. My friend was the eighth on the list, and
therefore he would have been among the third lot to go up.
A priest went about among them with a cross: and there was
about five minutes of time left for him to live.
‘He said that those five minutes seemed to him to be a
most interminable period, an enormous wealth of time; he
seemed to be living, in these minutes, so many lives that
there was no need as yet to think of that last moment, so
that he made several arrangements, dividing up the time
into portions—one for saying farewell to his companions,
two minutes for that; then a couple more for thinking over
his own life and career and all about himself; and another
minute for a last look around. He remembered having di-
86 The Idiot
vided his time like this quite well. While saying goodbye
to his friends he recollected asking one of them some very
usual everyday question, and being much interested in the
answer. Then having bade farewell, he embarked upon those
two minutes which he had allotted to looking into himself;
he knew beforehand what he was going to think about. He
wished to put it to himself as quickly and clearly as possible,
that here was he, a living, thinking man, and that in three
minutes he would be nobody; or if somebody or something,
then what and where? He thought he would decide this
question once for all in these last three minutes. A little way
off there stood a church, and its gilded spire glittered in the
sun. He remembered staring stubbornly at this spire, and at
the rays of light sparkling from it. He could not tear his eyes
from these rays of light; he got the idea that these rays were
his new nature, and that in three minutes he would become
one of them, amalgamated somehow with them.
‘The repugnance to what must ensue almost immediately,
and the uncertainty, were dreadful, he said; but worst of
all was the idea, ‘What should I do if I were not to die now?
What if I were to return to life again? What an eternity of
days, and all mine! How I should grudge and count up every minute of it, so as to waste not a single instant!’ He said
that this thought weighed so upon him and became such
a terrible burden upon his brain that he could not bear it,
and wished they would shoot him quickly and have done
with it.’
The prince paused and all waited, expecting him to go on
again and finish the story.
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 87
‘Is that all?’ asked Aglaya.
‘All? Yes,’ said the prince, emerging from a momentary
reverie.
‘And why did you tell us this?’
‘Oh, I happened to recall it, that’s all! It fitted into the
conversation—‘
‘You probably wish to deduce, prince,’ said Alexandra,
‘that moments of time cannot be reckoned by money value,
and that sometimes five minutes are worth priceless treasures. All this is very praiseworthy; but may I ask about
this friend of yours, who told you the terrible experience
of his life? He was reprieved, you say; in other words, they
did restore to him that ‘eternity of days.’ What did he do
with these riches of time? Did he keep careful account of
his minutes?’
‘Oh no, he didn’t! I asked him myself. He said that he had
not lived a bit as he had intended, and had wasted many,
and many a minute.’
‘Very well, then there’s an experiment, and the thing is
proved; one cannot live and count each moment; say what
you like, but one CANNOT.’
‘That is true,’ said the prince, ‘I have thought so myself.
And yet, why shouldn’t one do it?’
‘You think, then, that you could live more wisely than
other people?’ said Aglaya.
‘I have had that idea.’
‘And you have it still?’
‘Yes—I have it still,’ the prince replied.
He had contemplated Aglaya until now, with a pleasant 
88 The Idiot
though rather timid smile, but as the last words fell from his
lips he began to laugh, and looked at her merrily.
‘You are not very modest!’ said she.
‘But how brave you are!’ said he. ‘You are laughing, and
I— that man’s tale impressed me so much, that I dreamt of
it afterwards; yes, I dreamt of those five minutes …’
He looked at his listeners again with that same serious,
searching expression.
‘You are not angry with me?’ he asked suddenly, and with
a kind of nervous hurry, although he looked them straight
in the face.
‘Why should we be angry?’ they cried.
‘Only because I seem to be giving you a lecture, all the
time!’
At this they laughed heartily.
‘Please don’t be angry with me,’ continued the prince. ‘I
know very well that I have seen less of life than other people, and have less knowledge of it. I must appear to speak
strangely sometimes …’
He said the last words nervously.
‘You say you have been happy, and that proves you have
lived, not less, but more than other people. Why make all
these excuses?’ interrupted Aglaya in a mocking tone of
voice. ‘Besides, you need not mind about lecturing us; you
have nothing to boast of. With your quietism, one could
live happily for a hundred years at least. One might show
you the execution of a felon, or show you one’s little finger.
You could draw a moral from either, and be quite satisfied.
That sort of existence is easy enough.’

‘I can’t understand why you always fly into a temper,’ said
Mrs. Epanchin, who had been listening to the conversation
and examining the faces of the speakers in turn. ‘I do not
understand what you mean. What has your little finger to
do with it? The prince talks well, though he is not amusing.
He began all right, but now he seems sad.’
‘Never mind, mamma! Prince, I wish you had seen an
execution,’ said Aglaya. ‘I should like to ask you a question
about that, if you had.’
‘I have seen an execution,’ said the prince.
‘You have!’ cried Aglaya. ‘I might have guessed it. That’s a
fitting crown to the rest of the story. If you have seen an execution, how can you say you lived happily all the while?’
‘But is there capital punishment where you were?’ asked
Adelaida.
‘I saw it at Lyons. Schneider took us there, and as soon as
we arrived we came in for that.’
‘Well, and did you like it very much? Was it very edifying
and instructive?’ asked Aglaya.
‘No, I didn’t like it at all, and was ill after seeing it; but I
confess I stared as though my eyes were fixed to the sight. I
could not tear them away.’
‘I, too, should have been unable to tear my eyes away,’
said Aglaya.
‘They do not at all approve of women going to see an execution there. The women who do go are condemned for it
afterwards in the newspapers.’
‘That is, by contending that it is not a sight for women
they admit that it is a sight for men. I congratulate them 
90 The Idiot
on the deduction. I suppose you quite agree with them,
prince?’
‘Tell us about the execution,’ put in Adelaida.
‘I would much rather not, just now,’ said the prince, a
little disturbed and frowning slightly;
‘ You don’t seem to want to tell us,’ said Aglaya, with a
mocking air.
‘ No,—the thing is, I was telling all about the execution a
little while ago, and—‘
‘Whom did you tell about it?’
‘The man-servant, while I was waiting to see the general.’
‘Our man-servant?’ exclaimed several voices at once.
‘Yes, the one who waits in the entrance hall, a greyish,
redfaced man—‘
‘The prince is clearly a democrat,’ remarked Aglaya.
‘Well, if you could tell Aleksey about it, surely you can
tell us too.’
‘I do so want to hear about it,’ repeated Adelaida.
‘Just now, I confess,’ began the prince, with more animation, ‘when you asked me for a subject for a picture, I
confess I had serious thoughts of giving you one. I thought
of asking you to draw the face of a criminal, one minute before the fall of the guillotine, while the wretched man is still
standing on the scaffold, preparatory to placing his neck on
the block.’
‘What, his face? only his face?’ asked Adelaida. ‘That
would be a strange subject indeed. And what sort of a picture would that make?’
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 91
‘Oh, why not?’ the prince insisted, with some warmth.
‘When I was in Basle I saw a picture very much in that
style—I should like to tell you about it; I will some time or
other; it struck me very forcibly.’
‘Oh, you shall tell us about the Basle picture another time;
now we must have all about the execution,’ said Adelaida.
‘Tell us about that face as; it appeared to your imagination-how should it be drawn?—just the face alone, do you
mean?’
‘It was just a minute before the execution,’ began the
prince, readily, carried away by the recollection and evidently forgetting everything else in a moment; ‘just at the
instant when he stepped off the ladder on to the scaffold.
He happened to look in my direction: I saw his eyes and
understood all, at once—but how am I to describe it? I do
so wish you or somebody else could draw it, you, if possible.
I thought at the time what a picture it would make. You
must imagine all that went before, of course, all—all. He
had lived in the prison for some time and had not expected that the execution would take place for at least a week
yet—he had counted on all the formalities and so on taking
time; but it so happened that his papers had been got ready
quickly. At five o’clock in the morning he was asleep—it
was October, and at five in the morning it was cold and dark.
The governor of the prison comes in on tip-toe and touches
the sleeping man’s shoulder gently. He starts up. ‘What is
it?’ he says. ‘The execution is fixed for ten o’clock.’ He was
only just awake, and would not believe at first, but began to
argue that his papers would not be out for a week, and so on. 
92 The Idiot
When he was wide awake and realized the truth, he became
very silent and argued no more—so they say; but after a bit
he said: ‘It comes very hard on one so suddenly’ and then he
was silent again and said nothing.
‘The three or four hours went by, of course, in necessary
preparations—the priest, breakfast, (coffee, meat, and some
wine they gave him; doesn’t it seem ridiculous?) And yet I
believe these people give them a good breakfast out of pure
kindness of heart, and believe that they are doing a good
action. Then he is dressed, and then begins the procession
through the town to the scaffold. I think he, too, must feel
that he has an age to live still while they cart him along.
Probably he thought, on the way, ‘Oh, I have a long, long
time yet. Three streets of life yet! When we’ve passed this
street there’ll be that other one; and then that one where the
baker’s shop is on the right; and when shall we get there? It’s
ages, ages!’ Around him are crowds shouting, yelling—ten
thousand faces, twenty thousand eyes. All this has to be endured, and especially the thought: ‘Here are ten thousand
men, and not one of them is going to be executed, and yet I
am to die.’ Well, all that is preparatory.
‘At the scaffold there is a ladder, and just there he burst
into tears—and this was a strong man, and a terribly wicked one, they say! There was a priest with him the whole time,
talking; even in the cart as they drove along, he talked and
talked. Probably the other heard nothing; he would begin
to listen now and then, and at the third word or so he had
forgotten all about it.
‘At last he began to mount the steps; his legs were tied, so 
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 93
that he had to take very small steps. The priest, who seemed
to be a wise man, had stopped talking now, and only held
the cross for the wretched fellow to kiss. At the foot of the
ladder he had been pale enough; but when he set foot on the
scaffold at the top, his face suddenly became the colour of
paper, positively like white notepaper. His legs must have
become suddenly feeble and helpless, and he felt a choking in his throat—you know the sudden feeling one has in
moments of terrible fear, when one does not lose one’s wits,
but is absolutely powerless to move? If some dreadful thing
were suddenly to happen; if a house were just about to fall on
one;—don’t you know how one would long to sit down and
shut one’s eyes and wait, and wait? Well, when this terrible
feeling came over him, the priest quickly pressed the cross
to his lips, without a word—a little silver cross it wasand
he kept on pressing it to the man’s lips every second. And
whenever the cross touched his lips, the eyes would open
for a moment, and the legs moved once, and he kissed the
cross greedily, hurriedly—just as though he were anxious
to catch hold of something in case of its being useful to him
afterwards, though he could hardly have had any connected
religious thoughts at the time. And so up to the very block.
‘How strange that criminals seldom swoon at such a moment! On the contrary, the brain is especially active, and
works incessantly— probably hard, hard, hard—like an engine at full pressure. I imagine that various thoughts must
beat loud and fast through his head—all unfinished ones,
and strange, funny thoughts, very likely!—like this, for instance: ‘That man is looking at me, and he has a wart on 
94 The Idiot
his forehead! and the executioner has burst one of his buttons, and the lowest one is all rusty!’ And meanwhile he
notices and remembers everything. There is one point that
cannot be forgotten, round which everything else dances
and turns about; and because of this point he cannot faint,
and this lasts until the very final quarter of a second, when
the wretched neck is on the block and the victim listens and
waits and KNOWS— that’s the point, he KNOWS that he is
just NOW about to die, and listens for the rasp of the iron
over his head. If I lay there, I should certainly listen for that
grating sound, and hear it, too! There would probably be but
the tenth part of an instant left to hear it in, but one would
certainly hear it. And imagine, some people declare that
when the head flies off it is CONSCIOUS of having flown
off! Just imagine what a thing to realize! Fancy if consciousness were to last for even five seconds!
‘Draw the scaffold so that only the top step of the ladder
comes in clearly. The criminal must be just stepping on to
it, his face as white as note-paper. The priest is holding the
cross to his blue lips, and the criminal kisses it, and knows
and sees and understands everything. The cross and the
head—there’s your picture; the priest and the executioner, with his two assistants, and a few heads and eyes below.
Those might come in as subordinate accessories—a sort
of mist. There’s a picture for you.’ The prince paused, and
looked around.
‘Certainly that isn’t much like quietism,’ murmured Alexandra, half to herself.
‘Now tell us about your love affairs,’ said Adelaida, after 
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 95
a moment’s pause.
The prince gazed at her in amazement.
‘You know,’ Adelaida continued, ‘you owe us a description of the Basle picture; but first I wish to hear how you
fell in love. Don’t deny the fact, for you did, of course. Besides, you stop philosophizing when you are telling about
anything.’
‘Why are you ashamed of your stories the moment after
you have told them?’ asked Aglaya, suddenly.
‘How silly you are!’ said Mrs. Epanchin, looking indignantly towards the last speaker.
‘Yes, that wasn’t a clever remark,’ said Alexandra.
‘Don’t listen to her, prince,’ said Mrs. Epanchin; ‘she says
that sort of thing out of mischief. Don’t think anything of
their nonsense, it means nothing. They love to chaff, but
they like you. I can see it in their faces—I know their faces.’
‘I know their faces, too,’ said the prince, with a peculiar
stress on the words.
‘How so?’ asked Adelaida, with curiosity.
‘What do YOU know about our faces?’ exclaimed the
other two, in chorus.
But the prince was silent and serious. All awaited his reply.
‘I’ll tell you afterwards,’ he said quietly.
‘Ah, you want to arouse our curiosity!’ said Aglaya. ‘And
how terribly solemn you are about it!’
‘Very well,’ interrupted Adelaida, ‘then if you can read
faces so well, you must have been in love. Come now; I’ve
guessed—let’s have the secret!’
96 The Idiot
‘I have not been in love,’ said the prince, as quietly and
seriously as before. ‘I have been happy in another way.’
‘How, how?’
‘Well, I’ll tell you,’ said the prince, apparently in a deep
reverie.

‘Here you all are,’ began the prince, ‘settling yourselves
down to listen to me with so much curiosity, that if I
do not satisfy you you will probably be angry with me. No,
no! I’m only joking!’ he added, hastily, with a smile.
‘Well, then—they were all children there, and I was always among children and only with children. They were
the children of the village in which I lived, and they went
to the school there—all of them. I did not teach them, oh
no; there was a master for that, one Jules Thibaut. I may
have taught them some things, but I was among them just
as an outsider, and I passed all four years of my life there
among them. I wished for nothing better; I used to tell them
everything and hid nothing from them. Their fathers and
relations were very angry with me, because the children
could do nothing without me at last, and used to throng
after me at all times. The schoolmaster was my greatest enemy in the end! I had many enemies, and all because of the
children. Even Schneider reproached me. What were they
afraid of? One can tell a child everything, anything. I have
often been struck by the fact that parents know their children so little. They should not conceal so much from them.
How well even little children understand that their parents
conceal things from them, because they consider them too
young to understand! Children are capable of giving advice 
98 The Idiot
in the most important matters. How can one deceive these
dear little birds, when they look at one so sweetly and confidingly? I call them birds because there is nothing in the
world better than birds!
‘However, most of the people were angry with me about
one and the same thing; but Thibaut simply was jealous of
me. At first he had wagged his head and wondered how it
was that the children understood what I told them so well,
and could not learn from him; and he laughed like anything
when I replied that neither he nor I could teach them very
much, but that THEY might teach us a good deal.
‘How he could hate me and tell scandalous stories about
me, living among children as he did, is what I cannot understand. Children soothe and heal the wounded heart. I
remember there was one poor fellow at our professor’s who
was being treated for madness, and you have no idea what
those children did for him, eventually. I don’t think he was
mad, but only terribly unhappy. But I’ll tell you all about
him another day. Now I must get on with this story.
‘The children did not love me at first; I was such a sickly,
awkward kind of a fellow then—and I know I am ugly. Besides, I was a foreigner. The children used to laugh at me,
at first; and they even went so far as to throw stones at me,
when they saw me kiss Marie. I only kissed her once in my
life—no, no, don’t laugh!’ The prince hastened to suppress
the smiles of his audience at this point. ‘It was not a matter
of LOVE at all! If only you knew what a miserable creature
she was, you would have pitied her, just as I did. She belonged to our village. Her mother was an old, old woman, 
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 99
and they used to sell string and thread, and soap and tobacco, out of the window of their little house, and lived on the
pittance they gained by this trade. The old woman was ill
and very old, and could hardly move. Marie was her daughter, a girl of twenty, weak and thin and consumptive; but
still she did heavy work at the houses around, day by day.
Well, one fine day a commercial traveller betrayed her and
carried her off; and a week later he deserted her. She came
home dirty, draggled, and shoeless; she had walked for a
whole week without shoes; she had slept in the fields, and
caught a terrible cold; her feet were swollen and sore, and
her hands torn and scratched all over. She never had been
pretty even before; but her eyes were quiet, innocent, kind
eyes.
‘She was very quiet always—and I remember once, when
she had suddenly begun singing at her work, everyone said,
‘Marie tried to sing today!’ and she got so chaffed that she
was silent for ever after. She had been treated kindly in the
place before; but when she came back now—ill and shunned
and miserable—not one of them all had the slightest sympathy for her. Cruel people! Oh, what hazy understandings
they have on such matters! Her mother was the first to
show the way. She received her wrathfully, unkindly, and
with contempt. ‘You have disgraced me,’ she said. She was
the first to cast her into ignominy; but when they all heard
that Marie had returned to the village, they ran out to see
her and crowded into the little cottage—old men, children,
women, girls—such a hurrying, stamping, greedy crowd.
Marie was lying on the floor at the old woman’s feet, hun-
100 The Idiot
gry, torn, draggled, crying, miserable.
‘When everyone crowded into the room she hid her face
in her dishevelled hair and lay cowering on the floor. Everyone looked at her as though she were a piece of dirt off the
road. The old men scolded and condemned, and the young
ones laughed at her. The women condemned her too, and
looked at her contemptuously, just as though she were some
loathsome insect.
‘Her mother allowed all this to go on, and nodded her
head and encouraged them. The old woman was very ill
at that time, and knew she was dying (she really did die
a couple of months later), and though she felt the end approaching she never thought of forgiving her daughter, to
the very day of her death. She would not even speak to her.
She made her sleep on straw in a shed, and hardly gave her
food enough to support life.
‘Marie was very gentle to her mother, and nursed her, and
did everything for her; but the old woman accepted all her
services without a word and never showed her the slightest
kindness. Marie bore all this; and I could see when I got to
know her that she thought it quite right and fitting, considering herself the lowest and meanest of creatures.
‘When the old woman took to her bed finally, the other
old women in the village sat with her by turns, as the custom is there; and then Marie was quite driven out of the
house. They gave her no food at all, and she could not get
any work in the village; none would employ her. The men
seemed to consider her no longer a woman, they said such
dreadful things to her. Sometimes on Sundays, if they were 
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 101
drunk enough, they used to throw her a penny or two, into
the mud, and Marie would silently pick up the money. She
had began to spit blood at that time.
‘At last her rags became so tattered and torn that she was
ashamed of appearing in the village any longer. The children used to pelt her with mud; so she begged to be taken on
as assistant cowherd, but the cowherd would not have her.
Then she took to helping him without leave; and he saw how
valuable her assistance was to him, and did not drive her
away again; on the contrary, he occasionally gave her the
remnants of his dinner, bread and cheese. He considered
that he was being very kind. When the mother died, the
village parson was not ashamed to hold Marie up to public
derision and shame. Marie was standing at the coffin’s head,
in all her rags, crying.
‘A crowd of people had collected to see how she would cry.
The parson, a young fellow ambitious of becoming a great
preacher, began his sermon and pointed to Marie. ‘There,’
he said, ‘there is the cause of the death of this venerable
woman’—(which was a lie, because she had been ill for at
least two years)—‘there she stands before you, and dares
not lift her eyes from the ground, because she knows that
the finger of God is upon her. Look at her tatters and rags—
the badge of those who lose their virtue. Who is she? her
daughter!’ and so on to the end.
‘And just fancy, this infamy pleased them, all of them,
nearly. Only the children had altered—for then they were
all on my side and had learned to love Marie.
‘This is how it was: I had wished to do something for 
102 The Idiot
Marie; I longed to give her some money, but I never had a
farthing while I was there. But I had a little diamond pin,
and this I sold to a travelling pedlar; he gave me eight francs
for it—it was worth at least forty.
‘I long sought to meet Marie alone; and at last I did meet
her, on the hillside beyond the village. I gave her the eight
francs and asked her to take care of the money because I
could get no more; and then I kissed her and said that she
was not to suppose I kissed her with any evil motives or because I was in love with her, for that I did so solely out of
pity for her, and because from the first I had not accounted
her as guilty so much as unfortunate. I longed to console
and encourage her somehow, and to assure her that she was
not the low, base thing which she and others strove to make
out; but I don’t think she understood me. She stood before
me, dreadfully ashamed of herself, and with downcast eyes;
and when I had finished she kissed my hand. I would have
kissed hers, but she drew it away. Just at this moment the
whole troop of children saw us. (I found out afterwards that
they had long kept a watch upon me.) They all began whistling and clapping their hands, and laughing at us. Marie
ran away at once; and when I tried to talk to them, they
threw stones at me. All the village heard of it the same day,
and Marie’s position became worse than ever. The children
would not let her pass now in the streets, but annoyed her
and threw dirt at her more than before. They used to run
after her—she racing away with her poor feeble lungs panting and gasping, and they pelting her and shouting abuse
at her.
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 103
‘Once I had to interfere by force; and after that I took to
speaking to them every day and whenever I could. Occasionally they stopped and listened; but they teased Marie
all the same.
‘I told them how unhappy Marie was, and after a while
they stopped their abuse of her, and let her go by silently.
Little by little we got into the way of conversing together, the
children and I. I concealed nothing from them, I told them
all. They listened very attentively and soon began to be sorry
for Marie. At last some of them took to saying ‘Good-morning’ to her, kindly, when they met her. It is the custom there
to salute anyone you meet with ‘Good-morning’ whether
acquainted or not. I can imagine how astonished Marie was
at these first greetings from the children.
‘Once two little girls got hold of some food and took it
to her, and came back and told me. They said she had burst
into tears, and that they loved her very much now. Very
soon after that they all became fond of Marie, and at the
same time they began to develop the greatest affection for
myself. They often came to me and begged me to tell them
stories. I think I must have told stories well, for they did so
love to hear them. At last I took to reading up interesting
things on purpose to pass them on to the little ones, and
this went on for all the rest of my time there, three years.
Later, when everyone—even Schneider—was angry with
me for hiding nothing from the children, I pointed out how
foolish it was, for they always knew things, only they learnt
them in a way that soiled their minds but not so from me.
One has only to remember one’s own childhood to admit 
104 The Idiot
the truth of this. But nobody was convinced… It was two
weeks before her mother died that I had kissed Marie; and
when the clergyman preached that sermon the children
were all on my side.
‘When I told them what a shame it was of the parson to
talk as he had done, and explained my reason, they were so
angry that some of them went and broke his windows with
stones. Of course I stopped them, for that was not right, but
all the village heard of it, and how I caught it for spoiling the
children! Everyone discovered now that the little ones had
taken to being fond of Marie, and their parents were terribly
alarmed; but Marie was so happy. The children were forbidden to meet her; but they used to run out of the village to
the herd and take her food and things; and sometimes just
ran off there and kissed her, and said, ‘Je vous aime, Marie!’
and then trotted back again. They imagined that I was in
love with Marie, and this was the only point on which I did
not undeceive them, for they got such enjoyment out of it.
And what delicacy and tenderness they showed!
‘In the evening I used to walk to the waterfall. There was
a spot there which was quite closed in and hidden from view
by large trees; and to this spot the children used to come to
me. They could not bear that their dear Leon should love a
poor girl without shoes to her feet and dressed all in rags
and tatters. So, would you believe it, they actually clubbed
together, somehow, and bought her shoes and stockings,
and some linen, and even a dress! I can’t understand how
they managed it, but they did it, all together. When I asked
them about it they only laughed and shouted, and the lit-
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 105
tle girls clapped their hands and kissed me. I sometimes
went to see Marie secretly, too. She had become very ill, and
could hardly walk. She still went with the herd, but could
not help the herdsman any longer. She used to sit on a stone
near, and wait there almost motionless all day, till the herd
went home. Her consumption was so advanced, and she
was so weak, that she used to sit with closed eyes, breathing heavily. Her face was as thin as a skeleton’s, and sweat
used to stand on her white brow in large drops. I always
found her sitting just like that. I used to come up quietly to
look at her; but Marie would hear me, open her eyes, and
tremble violently as she kissed my hands. I did not take my
hand away because it made her happy to have it, and so she
would sit and cry quietly. Sometimes she tried to speak; but
it was very difficult to understand her. She was almost like a
madwoman, with excitement and ecstasy, whenever I came.
Occasionally the children came with me; when they did so,
they would stand some way off and keep guard over us, so
as to tell me if anybody came near. This was a great pleasure
to them.
‘When we left her, Marie used to relapse at once into
her old condition, and sit with closed eyes and motionless
limbs. One day she could not go out at all, and remained at
home all alone in the empty hut; but the children very soon
became aware of the fact, and nearly all of them visited her
that day as she lay alone and helpless in her miserable bed.
‘For two days the children looked after her, and then,
when the village people got to know that Marie was really
dying, some of the old women came and took it in turns to 
106 The Idiot
sit by her and look after her a bit. I think they began to be a
little sorry for her in the village at last; at all events they did
not interfere with the children any more, on her account.
‘Marie lay in a state of uncomfortable delirium the whole
while; she coughed dreadfully. The old women would not
let the children stay in the room; but they all collected outside the window each morning, if only for a moment, and
shouted ‘Bon jour, notre bonne Marie!’ and Marie no sooner
caught sight of, or heard them, and she became quite animated at once, and, in spite of the old women, would try to
sit up and nod her head and smile at them, and thank them.
The little ones used to bring her nice things and sweets to
eat, but she could hardly touch anything. Thanks to them,
I assure you, the girl died almost perfectly happy. She almost forgot her misery, and seemed to accept their love as a
sort of symbol of pardon for her offence, though she never
ceased to consider herself a dreadful sinner. They used to
flutter at her window just like little birds, calling out: ‘Nous
t’aimons, Marie!’
‘She died very soon; I had thought she would live much
longer. The day before her death I went to see her for the last
time, just before sunset. I think she recognized me, for she
pressed my hand.
‘Next morning they came and told me that Marie was
dead. The children could not be restrained now; they went
and covered her coffin with flowers, and put a wreath of
lovely blossoms on her head. The pastor did not throw any
more shameful words at the poor dead woman; but there
were very few people at the funeral. However, when it came 
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 107
to carrying the coffin, all the children rushed up, to carry
it themselves. Of course they could not do it alone, but they
insisted on helping, and walked alongside and behind, crying.
‘They have planted roses all round her grave, and every
year they look alter the flowers and make Marie’s restingplace as beautiful as they can. I was in ill odour after all this
with the parents of the children, and especially with the
parson and schoolmaster. Schneider was obliged to promise that I should not meet them and talk to them; but we
conversed from a distance by signs, and they used to write
me sweet little notes. Afterwards I came closer than ever to
those little souls, but even then it was very dear to me, to
have them so fond of me.
‘Schneider said that I did the children great harm by
my pernicious ‘system’; what nonsense that was! And what
did he mean by my system? He said afterwards that he believed I was a child myself—just before I came away. ‘You
have the form and face of an adult’ he said, ‘but as regards
soul, and character, and perhaps even intelligence, you are
a child in the completest sense of the word, and always
will be, if you live to be sixty.’ I laughed very much, for of
course that is nonsense. But it is a fact that I do not care to
be among grown-up people and much prefer the society of
children. However kind people may be to me, I never feel
quite at home with them, and am always glad to get back
to my little companions. Now my companions have always
been children, not because I was a child myself once, but
because young things attract me. On one of the first days 
108 The Idiot
of my stay in Switzerland, I was strolling about alone and
miserable, when I came upon the children rushing noisily
out of school, with their slates and bags, and books, their
games, their laughter and shouts—and my soul went out
to them. I stopped and laughed happily as I watched their
little feet moving so quickly. Girls and boys, laughing and
crying; for as they went home many of them found time to
fight and make peace, to weep and play. I forgot my troubles
in looking at them. And then, all those three years, I tried to
understand why men should be for ever tormenting themselves. I lived the life of a child there, and thought I should
never leave the little village; indeed, I was far from thinking
that I should ever return to Russia. But at last I recognized
the fact that Schneider could not keep me any longer. And
then something so important happened, that Schneider
himself urged me to depart. I am going to see now if can get
good advice about it. Perhaps my lot in life will be changed;
but that is not the principal thing. The principal thing is the
entire change that has already come over me. I left many
things behind me—too many. They have gone. On the journey I said to myself, ‘I am going into the world of men. I
don’t know much, perhaps, but a new life has begun for me.’
I made up my mind to be honest, and steadfast in accomplishing my task. Perhaps I shall meet with troubles and
many disappointments, but I have made up my mind to
be polite and sincere to everyone; more cannot be asked of
me. People may consider me a child if they like. I am often
called an idiot, and at one time I certainly was so ill that I
was nearly as bad as an idiot; but I am not an idiot now. How 
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 109
can I possibly be so when I know myself that I am considered one?
‘When I received a letter from those dear little souls,
while passing through Berlin, I only then realized how
much I loved them. It was very, very painful, getting that
first little letter. How melancholy they had been when they
saw me off! For a month before, they had been talking of my
departure and sorrowing over it; and at the waterfall, of an
evening, when we parted for the night, they would hug me
so tight and kiss me so warmly, far more so than before. And
every now and then they would turn up one by one when
I was alone, just to give me a kiss and a hug, to show their
love for me. The whole flock went with me to the station,
which was about a mile from the village, and every now and
then one of them would stop to throw his arms round me,
and all the little girls had tears in their voices, though they
tried hard not to cry. As the train steamed out of the station,
I saw them all standing on the platform waving to me and
crying ‘Hurrah!’ till they were lost in the distance.
‘I assure you, when I came in here just now and saw your
kind faces (I can read faces well) my heart felt light for the
first time since that moment of parting. I think I must be
one of those who are born to be in luck, for one does not often meet with people whom one feels he can love from the
first sight of their faces; and yet, no sooner do I step out of
the railway carriage than I happen upon you!
‘I know it is more or less a shamefaced thing to speak of
one’s feelings before others; and yet here am I talking like
this to you, and am not a bit ashamed or shy. I am an un-
110 The Idiot
sociable sort of fellow and shall very likely not come to see
you again for some time; but don’t think the worse of me for
that. It is not that I do not value your society; and you must
never suppose that I have taken offence at anything.
‘You asked me about your faces, and what I could read
in them; I will tell you with the greatest pleasure. You,
Adelaida Ivanovna, have a very happy face; it is the most
sympathetic of the three. Not to speak of your natural beauty, one can look at your face and say to one’s self, ‘She has
the face of a kind sister.’ You are simple and merry, but you
can see into another’s heart very quickly. That’s what I read
in your face.
‘You too, Alexandra Ivanovna, have a very lovely face;
but I think you may have some secret sorrow. Your heart is
undoubtedly a kind, good one, but you are not merry. There
is a certain suspicion of ‘shadow’ in your face, like in that
of Holbein’s Madonna in Dresden. So much for your face.
Have I guessed right?
‘As for your face, Lizabetha Prokofievna, I not only think,
but am perfectly SURE, that you are an absolute child—in
all, in all, mind, both good and bad-and in spite of your
years. Don’t be angry with me for saying so; you know what
my feelings for children are. And do not suppose that I am
so candid out of pure simplicity of soul. Oh dear no, it is by
no means the case! Perhaps I have my own very profound
object in view.’

When the prince ceased speaking all were gazing merrily at him— even Aglaya; but Lizabetha Prokofievna
looked the jolliest of all.
‘Well!’ she cried, ‘we HAVE ‘put him through his paces,’
with a vengeance! My dears, you imagined, I believe, that
you were about to patronize this young gentleman, like
some poor protege picked up somewhere, and taken under
your magnificent protection. What fools we were, and what
a specially big fool is your father! Well done, prince! I assure
you the general actually asked me to put you through your
paces, and examine you. As to what you said about my face,
you are absolutely correct in your judgment. I am a child,
and know it. I knew it long before you said so; you have
expressed my own thoughts. I think your nature and mine
must be extremely alike, and I am very glad of it. We are
like two drops of water, only you are a man and I a woman,
and I’ve not been to Switzerland, and that is all the difference between us.’
‘Don’t be in a hurry, mother; the prince says that he has
some motive behind his simplicity,’ cried Aglaya.
‘Yes, yes, so he does,’ laughed the others.
‘Oh, don’t you begin bantering him,’ said mamma. ‘He is
probably a good deal cleverer than all three of you girls put
together. We shall see. Only you haven’t told us anything 
112 The Idiot
about Aglaya yet, prince; and Aglaya and I are both waiting to hear.’
‘I cannot say anything at present. I’ll tell you afterwards.’
‘Why? Her face is clear enough, isn’t it?’
‘Oh yes, of course. You are very beautiful, Aglaya Ivanovna, so beautiful that one is afraid to look at you.’
‘Is that all? What about her character?’ persisted Mrs. Epanchin.
‘It is difficult to judge when such beauty is concerned. I
have not prepared my judgment. Beauty is a riddle.’
‘That means that you have set Aglaya a riddle!’ said Adelaida. ‘Guess it, Aglaya! But she’s pretty, prince, isn’t she?’
‘Most wonderfully so,’ said the latter, warmly, gazing at
Aglaya with admiration. ‘Almost as lovely as Nastasia Philipovna, but quite a different type.’
All present exchanged looks of surprise.
‘As lovely as WHO?’ said Mrs. Epanchin. ‘As NASTASIA
PHILIPOVNA? Where have you seen Nastasia Philipovna?
What Nastasia Philipovna?’
‘Gavrila Ardalionovitch showed the general her portrait
just now.’
‘How so? Did he bring the portrait for my husband?’
‘Only to show it. Nastasia Philipovna gave it to Gavrila
Ardalionovitch today, and the latter brought it here to show
to the general.’
‘I must see it!’ cried Mrs. Epanchin. ‘Where is the portrait? If she gave it to him, he must have it; and he is still in
the study. He never leaves before four o’clock on Wednesdays. Send for Gavrila Ardalionovitch at once. No, I don’t

long to see HIM so much. Look here, dear prince, BE so
kind, will you? Just step to the study and fetch this portrait!
Say we want to look at it. Please do this for me, will you?’
‘He is a nice fellow, but a little too simple,’ said Adelaida,
as the prince left the room.
‘He is, indeed,’ said Alexandra; ‘almost laughably so at
times.’
Neither one nor the other seemed to give expression to
her full thoughts.
‘He got out of it very neatly about our faces, though,’ said
Aglaya. He flattered us all round, even mamma.’
‘Nonsense’ cried the latter. ‘He did not flatter me. It was
I who found his appreciation flattering. I think you are a
great deal more foolish than he is. He is simple, of course,
but also very knowing. Just like myself.’
‘How stupid of me to speak of the portrait,’ thought the
prince as he entered the study, with a feeling of guilt at his
heart, ‘and yet, perhaps I was right after all.’ He had an idea,
unformed as yet, but a strange idea.
Gavrila Ardalionovitch was still sitting in the study, buried in a mass of papers. He looked as though he did not take
his salary from the public company, whose servant he was,
for a sinecure.
He grew very wroth and confused when the prince asked
for the portrait, and explained how it came about that he
had spoken of it.
‘Oh, curse it all,’ he said; ‘what on earth must you go blabbing for? You know nothing about the thing, and yet—idiot!’
he added, muttering the last word to himself in irrepress-
114 The Idiot
ible rage.
‘I am very sorry; I was not thinking at the time. I merely
said that Aglaya was almost as beautiful as Nastasia Philipovna.’
Gania asked for further details; and the prince once
more repeated the conversation. Gania looked at him with
ironical contempt the while.
‘Nastasia Philipovna,’ he began, and there paused; he was
clearly much agitated and annoyed. The prince reminded
him of the portrait.
‘Listen, prince,’ said Gania, as though an idea had just
struck him, ‘I wish to ask you a great favour, and yet I really
don’t know—‘
He paused again, he was trying to make up his mind to
something, and was turning the matter over. The prince
waited quietly. Once more Gania fixed him with intent and
questioning eyes.
‘Prince,’ he began again, ‘they are rather angry with me,
in there, owing to a circumstance which I need not explain,
so that I do not care to go in at present without an invitation. I particularly wish to speak to Aglaya, but I have
written a few words in case I shall not have the chance of
seeing her’ (here the prince observed a small note in his
hand), ‘and I do not know how to get my communication to
her. Don’t you think you could undertake to give it to her at
once, but only to her, mind, and so that no one else should
see you give it? It isn’t much of a secret, but still—Well, will
you do it?’
‘I don’t quite like it,’ replied the prince.
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 115
‘Oh, but it is absolutely necessary for me,’ Gania entreated. ‘Believe me, if it were not so, I would not ask you; how
else am I to get it to her? It is most important, dreadfully
important!’
Gania was evidently much alarmed at the idea that the
prince would not consent to take his note, and he looked at
him now with an expression of absolute entreaty.
‘Well, I will take it then.’
‘But mind, nobody is to see!’ cried the delighted Gania
‘And of course I may rely on your word of honour, eh?’
‘I won’t show it to anyone,’ said the prince.
‘The letter is not sealed—‘ continued Gania, and paused
in confusion.
‘Oh, I won’t read it,’ said the prince, quite simply.
He took up the portrait, and went out of the room.
Gania, left alone, clutched his head with his hands.
‘One word from her,’ he said, ‘one word from her, and I
may yet be free.’
He could not settle himself to his papers again, for agitation and excitement, but began walking up and down the
room from corner to corner.
The prince walked along, musing. He did not like his
commission, and disliked the idea of Gania sending a note
to Aglaya at all; but when he was two rooms distant from
the drawing-room, where they all were, he stopped a though
recalling something; went to the window, nearer the light,
and began to examine the portrait in his hand.
He longed to solve the mystery of something in the face
Nastasia Philipovna, something which had struck him as 
116 The Idiot
he looked at the portrait for the first time; the impression
had not left him. It was partly the fact of her marvellous
beauty that struck him, and partly something else. There
was a suggestion of immense pride and disdain in the face
almost of hatred, and at the same time something confiding and very full of simplicity. The contrast aroused a deep
sympathy in his heart as he looked at the lovely face. The
blinding loveliness of it was almost intolerable, this pale
thin face with its flaming eyes; it was a strange beauty.
The prince gazed at it for a minute or two, then glanced
around him, and hurriedly raised the portrait to his lips.
When, a minute after, he reached the drawing-room door,
his face was quite composed. But just as he reached the door
he met Aglaya coming out alone.
‘Gavrila Ardalionovitch begged me to give you this,’ he
said, handing her the note.
Aglaya stopped, took the letter, and gazed strangely into
the prince’s eyes. There was no confusion in her face; a little
surprise, perhaps, but that was all. By her look she seemed
merely to challenge the prince to an explanation as to how
he and Gania happened to be connected in this matter. But
her expression was perfectly cool and quiet, and even condescending.
So they stood for a moment or two, confronting one another. At length a faint smile passed over her face, and she
passed by him without a word.
Mrs. Epanchin examined the portrait of Nastasia Philipovna for some little while, holding it critically at arm’s
length.
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 117
‘Yes, she is pretty,’ she said at last, ‘even very pretty. I have
seen her twice, but only at a distance. So you admire this
kind of beauty, do you?’ she asked the prince, suddenly.
‘Yes, I do—this kind.’
‘Do you mean especially this kind?’
‘Yes, especially this kind.’
‘Why?’
‘There is much suffering in this face,’ murmured the
prince, more as though talking to himself than answering
the question.
‘I think you are wandering a little, prince,’ Mrs. Epanchin decided, after a lengthened survey of his face; and
she tossed the portrait on to the table, haughtily.
Alexandra took it, and Adelaida came up, and both the
girls examined the photograph. Just then Aglaya entered
the room.
‘What a power!’ cried Adelaida suddenly, as she earnestly
examined the portrait over her sister’s shoulder.
‘Whom? What power?’ asked her mother, crossly.
‘Such beauty is real power,’ said Adelaida. ‘With such
beauty as that one might overthrow the world.’ She returned to her easel thoughtfully.
Aglaya merely glanced at the portrait—frowned, and put
out her underlip; then went and sat down on the sofa with
folded hands. Mrs. Epanchin rang the bell.
‘Ask Gavrila Ardalionovitch to step this way,’ said she to
the man who answered.
‘Mamma!’ cried Alexandra, significantly.
‘I shall just say two words to him, that’s all,’ said her 
118 The Idiot
mother, silencing all objection by her manner; she was evidently seriously put out. ‘You see, prince, it is all secrets
with us, just now—all secrets. It seems to be the etiquette of
the house, for some reason or, other. Stupid nonsense, and
in a matter which ought to be approached with all candour
and openheartedness. There is a marriage being talked of,
and I don’t like this marriage—‘
‘Mamma, what are you saying?’ said Alexandra again,
hurriedly.
‘Well, what, my dear girl? As if you can possibly like it
yourself? The heart is the great thing, and the rest is all rubbish—though one must have sense as well. Perhaps sense is
really the great thing. Don’t smile like that, Aglaya. I don’t
contradict myself. A fool with a heart and no brains is just
as unhappy as a fool with brains and no heart. I am one and
you are the other, and therefore both of us suffer, both of us
are unhappy.’
‘Why are you so unhappy, mother?’ asked Adelaida, who
alone of all the company seemed to have preserved her good
temper and spirits up to now.
‘In the first place, because of my carefully brought-up
daughters,’ said Mrs. Epanchin, cuttingly; ‘and as that is
the best reason I can give you we need not bother about any
other at present. Enough of words, now! We shall see how
both of you (I don’t count Aglaya) will manage your business, and whether you, most revered Alexandra Ivanovna,
will be happy with your fine mate.’
‘Ah!’ she added, as Gania suddenly entered the room,
‘here’s another marrying subject. How do you do?’ she con-
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 119
tinued, in response to Gania’s bow; but she did not invite
him to sit down. ‘You are going to be married?’
‘Married? how—what marriage?’ murmured Gania,
overwhelmed with confusion.
‘Are you about to take a wife? I ask,—if you prefer that
expression.’
‘No, no I-I—no!’ said Gania, bringing out his lie with a
telltale blush of shame. He glanced keenly at Aglaya, who
was sitting some way off, and dropped his eyes immediately.
Aglaya gazed coldly, intently, and composedly at him,
without taking her eyes off his face, and watched his confusion.
‘No? You say no, do you?’ continued the pitiless Mrs.
General. ‘Very well, I shall remember that you told me this
Wednesday morning, in answer to my question, that you
are not going to be married. What day is it, Wednesday,
isn’t it?’
‘Yes, I think so!’ said Adelaida.
‘You never know the day of the week; what’s the day of
the month?’
‘Twenty-seventh!’ said Gania.
‘Twenty-seventh; very well. Good-bye now; you have a
good deal to do, I’m sure, and I must dress and go out. Take
your portrait. Give my respects to your unfortunate mother,
Nina Alexandrovna. Au revoir, dear prince, come in and
see us often, do; and I shall tell old Princess Bielokonski
about you. I shall go and see her on purpose. And listen,
my dear boy, I feel sure that God has sent you to Petersburg 
120 The Idiot
from Switzerland on purpose for me. Maybe you will have
other things to do, besides, but you are sent chiefly for my
sake, I feel sure of it. God sent you to me! Au revoir! Alexandra, come with me, my dear.’
Mrs. Epanchin left the room.
Gania—confused, annoyed, furious—took up his portrait, and turned to the prince with a nasty smile on his
face.
‘Prince,’ he said, ‘I am just going home. If you have not
changed your mind as to living with us, perhaps you would
like to come with me. You don’t know the address, I believe?’
‘Wait a minute, prince,’ said Aglaya, suddenly rising
from her seat, ‘do write something in my album first, will
you? Father says you are a most talented caligraphist; I’ll
bring you my book in a minute.’ She left the room.
‘Well, au revoir, prince,’ said Adelaida, ‘I must be going
too.’ She pressed the prince’s hand warmly, and gave him a
friendly smile as she left the room. She did not so much as
look at Gania.
‘This is your doing, prince,’ said Gania, turning on the
latter so soon as the others were all out of the room. ‘This
is your doing, sir! YOU have been telling them that I am
going to be married!’ He said this in a hurried whisper, his
eyes flashing with rage and his face ablaze. ‘You shameless
tattler!’
‘I assure you, you are under a delusion,’ said the prince,
calmly and politely. ‘I did not even know that you were to
be married.’

‘You heard me talking about it, the general and me. You
heard me say that everything was to be settled today at Nastasia Philipovna’s, and you went and blurted it out here. You
lie if you deny it. Who else could have told them Devil take
it, sir, who could have told them except yourself? Didn’t the
old woman as good as hint as much to me?’
‘If she hinted to you who told her you must know best, of
course; but I never said a word about it.’
‘Did you give my note? Is there an answer?’ interrupted
Gania, impatiently.
But at this moment Aglaya came back, and the prince
had no time to reply.
‘There, prince,’ said she, ‘there’s my album. Now choose a
page and write me something, will you? There’s a pen, a new
one; do you mind a steel one? I have heard that you caligraphists don’t like steel pens.’
Conversing with the prince, Aglaya did not even seem
to notice that Gania was in the room. But while the prince
was getting his pen ready, finding a page, and making his
preparations to write, Gania came up to the fireplace where
Aglaya was standing, to the right of the prince, and in trembling, broken accents said, almost in her ear:
‘One word, just one word from you, and I’m saved.’
The prince turned sharply round and looked at both of
them. Gania’s face was full of real despair; he seemed to
have said the words almost unconsciously and on the impulse of the moment.
Aglaya gazed at him for some seconds with precisely the
same composure and calm astonishment as she had shown 
122 The Idiot
a little while before, when the prince handed her the note,
and it appeared that this calm surprise and seemingly absolute incomprehension of what was said to her, were more
terribly overwhelming to Gania than even the most plainly
expressed disdain would have been.
‘What shall I write?’ asked the prince.
‘I’ll dictate to you,’ said Aglaya, coming up to the table.
‘Now then, are you ready? Write, ‘I never condescend to bargain!’ Now put your name and the date. Let me see it.’
The prince handed her the album.
‘Capital! How beautifully you have written it! Thanks so
much. Au revoir, prince. Wait a minute,’; she added, ‘I want
to give you something for a keepsake. Come with me this
way, will you?’
The prince followed her. Arrived at the dining-room, she
stopped.
‘Read this,’ she said, handing him Gania’s note.
The prince took it from her hand, but gazed at her in bewilderment.
‘Oh! I KNOW you haven’t read it, and that you could never be that man’s accomplice. Read it, I wish you to read it.’
The letter had evidently been written in a hurry:
‘My fate is to be decided today’ (it ran), ‘you know how.
This day I must give my word irrevocably. I have no right
to ask your help, and I dare not allow myself to indulge in
any hopes; but once you said just one word, and that word
lighted up the night of my life, and became the beacon of
my days. Say one more such word, and save me from utter
ruin. Only tell me, ‘break off the whole thing!’ and I will 
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 123
do so this very day. Oh! what can it cost you to say just this
one word? In doing so you will but be giving me a sign of
your sympathy for me, and of your pity; only this, only this;
nothing more, NOTHING. I dare not indulge in any hope,
because I am unworthy of it. But if you say but this word, I
will take up my cross again with joy, and return once more
to my battle with poverty. I shall meet the storm and be glad
of it; I shall rise up with renewed strength.
‘Send me back then this one word of sympathy, only
sympathy, I swear to you; and oh! do not be angry with the
audacity of despair, with the drowning man who has dared
to make this last effort to save himself from perishing beneath the waters.
‘G.L.’
‘This man assures me,’ said Aglaya, scornfully, when the
prince had finished reading the letter, ‘that the words ‘break
off everything’ do not commit me to anything whatever;
and himself gives me a written guarantee to that effect, in
this letter. Observe how ingenuously he underlines certain
words, and how crudely he glosses over his hidden thoughts.
He must know that if he ‘broke off everything,’ FIRST, by
himself, and without telling me a word about it or having
the slightest hope on my account, that in that case I should
perhaps be able to change my opinion of him, and even accept his—friendship. He must know that, but his soul is
such a wretched thing. He knows it and cannot make up
his mind; he knows it and yet asks for guarantees. He cannot bring himself to TRUST, he wants me to give him hopes
of myself before he lets go of his hundred thousand rou-
124 The Idiot
bles. As to the ‘former word’ which he declares ‘lighted up
the night of his life,’ he is simply an impudent liar; I merely
pitied him once. But he is audacious and shameless. He immediately began to hope, at that very moment. I saw it. He
has tried to catch me ever since; he is still fishing for me.
Well, enough of this. Take the letter and give it back to him,
as soon as you have left our house; not before, of course.’
‘And what shall I tell him by way of answer?’
‘Nothing—of course! That’s the best answer. Is it the case
that you are going to live in his house?’
‘Yes, your father kindly recommended me to him.’
‘Then look out for him, I warn you! He won’t forgive you
easily, for taking back the letter.’
Aglaya pressed the prince’s hand and left the room. Her
face was serious and frowning; she did not even smile as she
nodded goodbye to him at the door.
‘I’ll just get my parcel and we’ll go,’ said the prince to
Gania, as he re-entered the drawing-room. Gania stamped
his foot with impatience. His face looked dark and gloomy
with rage.
At last they left the house behind them, the prince carrying his bundle.
‘The answer—quick—the answer!’ said Gania, the instant they were outside. ‘What did she say? Did you give
the letter?’ The prince silently held out the note. Gania was
struck motionless with amazement.
‘How, what? my letter?’ he cried. ‘He never delivered it!
I might have guessed it, oh! curse him! Of course she did
not understand what I meant, naturally! Why-why-WHY 
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 125
didn’t you give her the note, you—‘
‘Excuse me; I was able to deliver it almost immediately
after receiving your commission, and I gave it, too, just as
you asked me to. It has come into my hands now because
Aglaya Ivanovna has just returned it to me.’
‘How? When?’
‘As soon as I finished writing in her album for her, and
when she asked me to come out of the room with her (you
heard?), we went into the dining-room, and she gave me
your letter to read, and then told me to return it.’
‘To READ?’ cried Gania, almost at the top of his voice;
‘to READ, and you read it?’
And again he stood like a log in the middle of the pavement; so amazed that his mouth remained open after the
last word had left it.
‘Yes, I have just read it.’
‘And she gave it you to read herself—HERSELF?’
‘Yes, herself; and you may believe me when I tell you that
I would not have read it for anything without her permission.’
Gania was silent for a minute or two, as though thinking
out some problem. Suddenly he cried:
‘It’s impossible, she cannot have given it to you to read!
You are lying. You read it yourself!’
‘I am telling you the truth,’ said the prince in his former
composed tone of voice; ‘and believe me, I am extremely
sorry that the circumstance should have made such an unpleasant impression upon you!’
‘But, you wretched man, at least she must have said some-
126 The Idiot
thing? There must be SOME answer from her!’
‘Yes, of course, she did say something!’
‘Out with it then, damn it! Out with it at once!’ and Gania stamped his foot twice on the pavement.
‘As soon as I had finished reading it, she told me that
you were fishing for her; that you wished to compromise
her so far as to receive some hopes from her, trusting to
which hopes you might break with the prospect of receiving
a hundred thousand roubles. She said that if you had done
this without bargaining with her, if you had broken with
the money prospects without trying to force a guarantee
out of her first, she might have been your friend. That’s all,
I think. Oh no, when I asked her what I was to say, as I took
the letter, she replied that ‘no answer is the best answer.’ I
think that was it. Forgive me if I do not use her exact expressions. I tell you the sense as I understood it myself.’
Ungovernable rage and madness took entire possession
of Gania, and his fury burst out without the least attempt
at restraint.
‘Oh! that’s it, is it!’ he yelled. ‘She throws my letters out of
the window, does she! Oh! and she does not condescend to
bargain, while I DO, eh? We shall see, we shall see! I shall
pay her out for this.’
He twisted himself about with rage, and grew paler and
paler; he shook his fist. So the pair walked along a few steps.
Gania did not stand on ceremony with the prince; he behaved just as though he were alone in his room. He clearly
counted the latter as a nonentity. But suddenly he seemed to
have an idea, and recollected himself.
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 127
‘But how was it?’ he asked, ‘how was it that you (idiot that
you are),’ he added to himself, ‘were so very confidential a
couple of hours after your first meeting with these people?
How was that, eh?’
Up to this moment jealousy had not been one of his torments; now it suddenly gnawed at his heart.
‘That is a thing I cannot undertake to explain,’ replied
the prince. Gania looked at him with angry contempt.
‘Oh! I suppose the present she wished to make to you,
when she took you into the dining-room, was her confidence, eh?’
‘I suppose that was it; I cannot explain it otherwise?’
‘But why, WHY? Devil take it, what did you do in there?
Why did they fancy you? Look here, can’t you remember exactly what you said to them, from the very beginning? Can’t
you remember?’
‘Oh, we talked of a great many things. When first I went
in we began to speak of Switzerland.’
‘Oh, the devil take Switzerland!’
‘Then about executions.’
‘Executions?’
‘Yes—at least about one. Then I told the whole three years’
story of my life, and the history of a poor peasant girl—‘
‘Oh, damn the peasant girl! go on, go on!’ said Gania, impatiently.
‘Then how Schneider told me about my childish nature,
and—‘
‘Oh, CURSE Schneider and his dirty opinions! Go on.’
‘Then I began to talk about faces, at least about the EX-
128 The Idiot
PRESSIONS of faces, and said that Aglaya Ivanovna was
nearly as lovely as Nastasia Philipovna. It was then I blurted
out about the portrait—‘
‘But you didn’t repeat what you heard in the study? You
didn’t repeat that—eh?’
‘No, I tell you I did NOT.’
‘Then how did they—look here! Did Aglaya show my letter to the old lady?’
‘Oh, there I can give you my fullest assurance that she did
NOT. I was there all the while—she had no time to do it!’
‘But perhaps you may not have observed it, oh, you
damned idiot, you!’ he shouted, quite beside himself with
fury. ‘You can’t even describe what went on.’
Gania having once descended to abuse, and receiving no
check, very soon knew no bounds or limit to his licence, as
is often the way in such cases. His rage so blinded him that
he had not even been able to detect that this ‘idiot,’ whom
he was abusing to such an extent, was very far from being
slow of comprehension, and had a way of taking in an impression, and afterwards giving it out again, which was very
un-idiotic indeed. But something a little unforeseen now
occurred.
‘I think I ought to tell you, Gavrila Ardalionovitch,’ said
the prince, suddenly, ‘that though I once was so ill that I
really was little better than an idiot, yet now I am almost recovered, and that, therefore, it is not altogether pleasant to
be called an idiot to my face. Of course your anger is excusable, considering the treatment you have just experienced;
but I must remind you that you have twice abused me rather 
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 129
rudely. I do not like this sort of thing, and especially so at
the first time of meeting a man, and, therefore, as we happen to be at this moment standing at a crossroad, don’t you
think we had better part, you to the left, homewards, and I
to the right, here? I have twentyfive roubles, and I shall easily find a lodging.’
Gania was much confused, and blushed for shame ‘Do
forgive me, prince!’ he cried, suddenly changing his abusive
tone for one of great courtesy. ‘For Heaven’s sake, forgive
me! You see what a miserable plight I am in, but you hardly
know anything of the facts of the case as yet. If you did, I
am sure you would forgive me, at least partially. Of course
it was inexcusable of me, I know, but—‘
‘Oh, dear me, I really do not require such profuse apologies,’ replied the prince, hastily. ‘I quite understand how
unpleasant your position is, and that is what made you
abuse me. So come along to your house, after all. I shall be
delighted—‘
‘I am not going to let him go like this,’ thought Gania,
glancing angrily at the prince as they walked along. ‘ The
fellow has sucked everything out of me, and now he takes
off his mask— there’s something more than appears, here
we shall see. It shall all be as clear as water by tonight, everything!’
But by this time they had reached Gania’s house.
130 The Idiot
VIII
The flat occupied by Gania and his family was on the
third floor of the house. It was reached by a clean light
staircase, and consisted of seven rooms, a nice enough lodging, and one would have thought a little too good for a clerk
on two thousand roubles a year. But it was designed to accommodate a few lodgers on board terms, and had beer)
taken a few months since, much to the disgust of Gania, at
the urgent request of his mother and his sister, Varvara Ardalionovna, who longed to do something to increase the
family income a little, and fixed their hopes upon letting
lodgings. Gania frowned upon the idea. He thought it infra
dig, and did not quite like appearing in society afterwards—
that society in which he had been accustomed to pose up to
now as a young man of rather brilliant prospects. All these
concessions and rebuffs of fortune, of late, had wounded his
spirit severely, and his temper had become extremely irritable, his wrath being generally quite out of proportion to the
cause. But if he had made up his mind to put up with this
sort of life for a while, it was only on the plain understanding with his inner self that he would very soon change it all,
and have things as he chose again. Yet the very means by
which he hoped to make this change threatened to involve
him in even greater difficulties than he had had before.
The flat was divided by a passage which led straight out

of the entrance-hall. Along one side of this corridor lay the
three rooms which were designed for the accommodation
of the ‘highly recommended’ lodgers. Besides these three
rooms there was another small one at the end of the passage, close to the kitchen, which was allotted to General
Ivolgin, the nominal master of the house, who slept on a
wide sofa, and was obliged to pass into and out of his room
through the kitchen, and up or down the back stairs. Colia,
Gania’s young brother, a school-boy of thirteen, shared this
room with his father. He, too, had to sleep on an old sofa,
a narrow, uncomfortable thing with a torn rug over it; his
chief duty being to look after his father, who needed to be
watched more and more every day.
The prince was given the middle room of the three, the
first being occupied by one Ferdishenko, while the third
was empty.
But Gania first conducted the prince to the family apartments. These consisted of a ‘salon,’ which became the
dining-room when required; a drawing-room, which was
only a drawing-room in the morning, and became Gania’s
study in the evening, and his bedroom at night; and lastly
Nina Alexandrovna’s and Varvara’s bedroom, a small, close
chamber which they shared together.
In a word, the whole place was confined, and a ‘tight fit’
for the party. Gania used to grind his teeth with rage over
the state of affairs; though he was anxious to be dutiful and
polite to his mother. However, it was very soon apparent to
anyone coming into the house, that Gania was the tyrant
of the family.
132 The Idiot
Nina Alexandrovna and her daughter were both seated
in the drawing-room, engaged in knitting, and talking to a
visitor, Ivan Petrovitch Ptitsin.
The lady of the house appeared to be a woman of about
fifty years of age, thin-faced, and with black lines under the
eves. She looked ill and rather sad; but her face was a pleasant one for all that; and from the first word that fell from
her lips, any stranger would at once conclude that she was
of a serious and particularly sincere nature. In spite of her
sorrowful expression, she gave the idea of possessing considerable firmness and decision.
Her dress was modest and simple to a degree, dark and
elderly in style; but both her face and appearance gave evidence that she had seen better days.
Varvara was a girl of some twenty-three summers, of
middle height, thin, but possessing a face which, without
being actually beautiful, had the rare quality of charm, and
might fascinate even to the extent of passionate regard.
She was very like her mother: she even dressed like her,
which proved that she had no taste for smart clothes. The expression of her grey eyes was merry and gentle, when it was
not, as lately, too full of thought and anxiety. The same decision and firmness was to be observed in her face as in her
mother’s, but her strength seemed to be more vigorous than
that of Nina Alexandrovna. She was subject to outbursts of
temper, of which even her brother was a little afraid.
The present visitor, Ptitsin, was also afraid of her. This
was a young fellow of something under thirty, dressed
plainly, but neatly. His manners were good, but rather pon-

derously so. His dark beard bore evidence to the fact that he
was not in any government employ. He could speak well, but
preferred silence. On the whole he made a decidedly agreeable impression. He was clearly attracted by Varvara, and
made no secret of his feelings. She trusted him in a friendly
way, but had not shown him any decided encouragement as
yet, which fact did not quell his ardour in the least.
Nina Alexandrovna was very fond of him, and had
grown quite confidential with him of late. Ptitsin, as was
well known, was engaged in the business of lending out
money on good security, and at a good rate of interest. He
was a great friend of Gania’s.
After a formal introduction by Gania (who greeted
his mother very shortly, took no notice of his sister, and
immediately marched Ptitsin out of the room), Nina Alexandrovna addressed a few kind words to the prince and
forthwith requested Colia, who had just appeared at the
door, to show him to the ‘ middle room.’
Colia was a nice-looking boy. His expression was simple
and confiding, and his manners were very polite and engaging.
‘Where’s your luggage?’ he asked, as he led the prince
away to his room.
‘I had a bundle; it’s in the entrance hall.’
‘I’ll bring it you directly. We only have a cook and one
maid, so I have to help as much as I can. Varia looks after
things, generally, and loses her temper over it. Gania says
you have only just arrived from Switzerland? ‘
‘Yes.’
134 The Idiot
‘Is it jolly there?’
‘Very.’
‘Mountains?’
‘Yes.’
‘I’ll go and get your bundle.’
Here Varvara joined them.
‘The maid shall bring your bed-linen directly. Have you
a portmanteau?’
‘No; a bundle—your brother has just gone to the hall for
it.’
‘There’s nothing there except this,’ said Colia, returning
at this moment. ‘Where did you put it?’
‘Oh! but that’s all I have,’ said the prince, taking it.
‘Ah! I thought perhaps Ferdishenko had taken it.’
‘Don’t talk nonsense,’ said Varia, severely. She seemed
put out, and was only just polite with the prince.
‘Oho!’ laughed the boy, ‘you can be nicer than that to ME,
you know—I’m not Ptitsin!’
‘You ought to be whipped, Colia, you silly boy. If you
want anything’ (to the prince) ‘please apply to the servant.
We dine at half-past four. You can take your dinner with us,
or have it in your room, just as you please. Come along, Colia, don’t disturb the prince.’
At the door they met Gania coming in.
‘Is father in?’ he asked. Colia whispered something in his
ear and went out.
‘Just a couple of words, prince, if you’ll excuse me. Don’t
blab over THERE about what you may see here, or in this
house as to all that about Aglaya and me, you know. Things

are not altogether pleasant in this establishment—devil
take it all! You’ll see. At all events keep your tongue to yourself for TODAY.’
‘I assure you I ‘blabbed’ a great deal less than you seem
to suppose,’ said the prince, with some annoyance. Clearly
the relations between Gania and himself were by no means
improving.
‘Oh I well; I caught it quite hot enough today, thanks to
you. However, I forgive you.’
‘I think you might fairly remember that I was not in any
way bound, I had no reason to be silent about that portrait.
You never asked me not to mention it.’
‘Pfu! what a wretched room this is—dark, and the window looking into the yard. Your coming to our house is, in
no respect, opportune. However, it’s not MY affair. I don’t
keep the lodgings.’
Ptitsin here looked in and beckoned to Gania, who hastily left the room, in spite of the fact that he had evidently
wished to say something more and had only made the remark about the room to gain time. The prince had hardly
had time to wash and tidy himself a little when the door
opened once more, and another figure appeared.
This was a gentleman of about thirty, tall, broadshouldered, and red-haired; his face was red, too, and he
possessed a pair of thick lips, a wide nose, small eyes, rather bloodshot, and with an ironical expression in them; as
though he were perpetually winking at someone. His whole
appearance gave one the idea of impudence; his dress was
shabby.
136 The Idiot
He opened the door just enough to let his head in. His
head remained so placed for a few seconds while he quietly scrutinized the room; the door then opened enough to
admit his body; but still he did not enter. He stood on the
threshold and examined the prince carefully. At last he gave
the door a final shove, entered, approached the prince, took
his hand and seated himself and the owner of the room on
two chairs side by side.
‘Ferdishenko,’ he said, gazing intently and inquiringly
into the prince’s eyes.
‘Very well, what next?’ said the latter, almost laughing in
his face.
‘A lodger here,’ continued the other, staring as before.
‘Do you wish to make acquaintance?’ asked the prince.
‘Ah!’ said the visitor, passing his fingers through his hair
and sighing. He then looked over to the other side of the
room and around it. ‘Got any money?’ he asked, suddenly.
‘Not much.’
‘How much?’
‘Twenty-five roubles.’
‘Let’s see it.’
The prince took his banknote out and showed it to Ferdishenko. The latter unfolded it and looked at it; then he
turned it round and examined the other side; then he held
it up to the light.
‘How strange that it should have browned so,’ he said, reflectively. ‘These twenty-five rouble notes brown in a most
extraordinary way, while other notes often grow paler. Take
it.’

The prince took his note. Ferdishenko rose.
‘I came here to warn you,’ he said. ‘In the first place, don’t
lend me any money, for I shall certainly ask you to.’
‘Very well.’
‘Shall you pay here?’
‘Yes, I intend to.’
‘Oh! I DON’T intend to. Thanks. I live here, next door to
you; you noticed a room, did you? Don’t come to me very
often; I shall see you here quite often enough. Have you seen
the general?’
‘No.’
‘Nor heard him?’
‘No; of course not.’
‘Well, you’ll both hear and see him soon; he even tries
to borrow money from me. Avis au lecteur. Good-bye; do
you think a man can possibly live with a name like Ferdishenko?’
‘Why not?’
‘Good-bye.’
And so he departed. The prince found out afterwards that
this gentleman made it his business to amaze people with
his originality and wit, but that it did not as a rule ‘come
off.’ He even produced a bad impression on some people,
which grieved him sorely; but he did not change his ways
for all that.
As he went out of the prince’s room, he collided with yet
another visitor coming in. Ferdishenko took the opportunity of making several warning gestures to the prince from
behind the new arrival’s back, and left the room in con-
138 The Idiot
scious pride.
This next arrival was a tall red-faced man of about fiftyfive, with greyish hair and whiskers, and large eyes which
stood out of their sockets. His appearance would have been
distinguished had it not been that he gave the idea of being
rather dirty. He was dressed in an old coat, and he smelled
of vodka when he came near. His walk was effective, and
he clearly did his best to appear dignified, and to impress
people by his manner.
This gentleman now approached the prince slowly, and
with a most courteous smile; silently took his hand and held
it in his own, as he examined the prince’s features as though
searching for familiar traits therein.
‘Tis he, ‘tis he!’ he said at last, quietly, but with much solemnity. ‘As though he were alive once more. I heard the
familiar name-the dear familiar name—and, oh. I how it
reminded me of the irrevocable past—Prince Muishkin, I
believe ?’
‘Exactly so.’
‘General Ivolgin—retired and unfortunate. May I ask
your Christian and generic names?’
‘Lef Nicolaievitch.’
‘So, so—the son of my old, I may say my childhood’s
friend, Nicolai Petrovitch.’
‘My father’s name was Nicolai Lvovitch.’
‘Lvovitch,’ repeated the general without the slightest
haste, and with perfect confidence, just as though he had
not committed himself the least in the world, but merely
made a little slip of the tongue. He sat down, and taking the

prince’s hand, drew him to a seat next to himself.
‘I carried you in my arms as a baby,’ he observed.
‘Really?’ asked the prince. ‘Why, it’s twenty years since
my father died.’
‘Yes, yes—twenty years and three months. We were educated together; I went straight into the army, and he—‘
‘My father went into the army, too. He was a sub-lieutenant in the Vasiliefsky regiment.’
‘No, sir—in the Bielomirsky; he changed into the latter
shortly before his death. I was at his bedside when he died,
and gave him my blessing for eternity. Your mother—‘ The
general paused, as though overcome with emotion.
